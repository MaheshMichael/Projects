Patching is managed as part of the release management process by the Release Coordination group that uses automatic deployment technology to support quarterly patching cycles. Change Orders are submitted to authorize the deployment of the patches. The automated patch deployment technology analyzes the servers and applies relevant patches to each server, as needed, during the monthly or quarterly scheduled patching process.\nThe Distributed Systems group is also responsible for sending OS update notifications to other ADP groups responsible for installing the OS patches for servers located outside the GETS North America hosting and data center facilities and groups that opt out of the mass-patching process.\nOS software, hardware, and infrastructure changes are requested by the GETS North America or Product teams and submitted using the CA Service Desk tool (Service Desk). Service Desk hardware and infrastructure change requests go through predetermined workflow steps through to implementation that includes obtaining approval(s) from the designated department(s). OS software, hardware, and infrastructure changes are tested in a non- production environment and approved by the designated system owner and/or the Change Advisory Board (CAB) before deployment.

The documentation may include knowledgebase records or links to ADP or vendor documentation.\nThe Corporate Mainframe System Technology Group prioritizes vendor software update notifications and usually groups them into quarterly releases. OS and database change requests are reviewed during the daily and weekly Change Advisory Board (CAB) meetings and require approval before they can be deployed.\nInformation Technology personnel test new operating system releases and modifications. Whenever possible, Mainframe operating system changes are tested in a non-production and Pilot environment before being deployed to the production environment. OS Release Changes require testing in the iAT environment and two pilots before general release. Product Version/Release Changes or New Product Installations require iAT testing and a minimum of one pilot before general release, and Parameter Changes require iAT testing.\nAccess to system software source code is limited via RACF to authorized personnel, primarily members of the Corporate Mainframe System Technology Group. Using file transfer over ADP's ESNet, the Corporate Mainframe System Technology Team remotely releases host operating system updates to the Mainframe production environment and installs the updates.

The network architecture is segregated into security zones using firewalls and other ACL constructs to restrict access to authorized network activity.\nConnections to the data centers from external networks are protected using encryption technologies. ADP associates working remotely use Virtual Private Network (VPN) via two-factor authentication.\nNetwork Detection and Response (NDR) systems are in place to monitor network activity. Global Network Services, under the Data Networks group, is responsible for the configuration of the network. Network equipment, including firewalls and other ACL constructs, are maintained and monitored by the Global Network Services group- If necessary, the Global Network Services personnel initiate corrective actions to resolve issues. Automated network and infrastructure monitoring tools are deployed to control and monitor the network and critical networking equipment. Issues are documented in Service Desk tickets.\nADP has developed a global infrastructure of security tools, referred to as T3. T3 globally integrates best-of- breed products to enable ADP to proactively monitor and identify potential security incidents or exposures. T3 captures billions of events daily (i.e., security logs, unusual network connections, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts, etc.), which are analyzed, correlated, and reviewed by the Critical Incident Response Center (CIRC).\nThe CIRC utilizes the Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) platform to track and report potential incidents that are created by the T3 infrastructure reported by associates, third parties, and/or clients. Archer supports both 'push' and 'pull' methods for incident creation, allowing for rapid triage and response to threats. Initial correlations of these incidents are performed by the various inputs into the SOAR platform where analysis and validation occur, and the results are memorialized in Archer and the security information data warehouse.\nInformation Security\nInformation security encompasses the controls that prevent and detect unauthorized access to information resources including physical access to facilities and logical access to information systems. The primary goal of information security is to restrict access to application programs, online transactions, and other computing resources to only authorized users.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

These guidelines provide a minimum-security baseline and apply to ADP business units.\nLogical Security\nADP's GSO is responsible for developing corporate-wide security standards. The individual business unit's IT departments or security groups are responsible for complying with corporate standards and administering logical security for internal ADP personnel on selected systems and applications. Formal policies and procedures are followed to establish appropriate access to information assets.\nThe GETS North America organization is responsible for authorizing and provisioning network and OS administrative access and for provisioning authorized network and OS-level access needed by application support personnel. The ADP business units are responsible for application logical access controls that are covered in the specific product SOC 1 reports and are excluded from the scope of this report.\nNetwork Access\nADP supports broadband Internet communications as the connectivity method to the GETS North America hosting and data center facilities.

Each user requires a unique user ID and password before access is granted to the network. In the US and Canada, ADP uses an IDM (Identity Management) system that automates the process of managers granting and revoking network access privileges for their direct reports. The process for provisioning and deprovisioning network access is initiated by HR either through direct notification or through the IDM system. The IDM system interfaces with AD to automatically create or disable the AD account.\nThe process for provisioning and deprovisioning ADP India associates' network access is initiated by HR. To obtain network access, a ticket is submitted to the ATM group. The ATM group grants network access to the new or transferred associate. For terminations and transfers out, management or HR submits a ticket to revoke access. The user account is disabled in AD by the system administrators in India and a ticket is submitted to ATM to remove the user account.\nFor ADP employees based in the Philippines, network access requests (for new hires and transfers in) are initiated by HR through a Service Desk ticket. A Service Desk ticket is then submitted to the System Administrators in the Philippines who grant network access.\nOS, Database, and Mainframe Access\nOnce network access is provisioned, associates can be given further access, including operating system, database, and Mainframe, based on their job responsibilities. Access is requested using the IDM system and requires proper approval by corresponding entitlement owners. If access is no longer needed, managers or entitlement owners submit a request to remove access using the IDM system. For terminated associates, request to remove access to operating systems, databases, and Mainframes is automatically submitted by the IDM system, which is either processed automatically via an interface or routed to the appropriate ADP group for processing.\nADP is in the process of transitioning to a new IDM system for access review and recertification. For systems that have been successfully migrated to the new tool, the LAT (Logical Access Team) team is responsible for coordinating the review of user listings based on a predefined review schedule. The review is initiated by the Campaign Owner using the IDM system. The IDM system sends email notifications to assigned reviewers and tracks their responses. Once the reviewers have validated their respective user listings, the campaign is finalized, and action is taken to modify user access where needed.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Password restrictions are configured in compliance with corporate standards that include periodic forced password changes, password complexity, and password history.\nThe Privileged Identity Management (PIM) password vaulting utility is installed on servers hosted at the GETS North America hosting and data center facilities and is used to control the default local administrative accounts and enforce password changes. Access to the PIM password vaulting utility is governed by AD groups created on ADP's network. OS administrator access to the stand-alone servers is restricted to authorized personnel through vaulted accounts. Associates must initially login to ADP's network and then, if they belong to an authorized AD group, they can access the PIM password vaulting utility. Revoking access to the PIM password vaulting utility relies on the revocation of the underlying AD access or removal from the AD group granting access to the vaults. Only a limited number of authorized personnel, based on assigned job responsibilities, have privileged (administrator level) access to the PIM password vaulting utility.\nAuthentication and Security - Mainframe\nFor Mainframe, logical access is controlled through IBM's Customer Information Control System (CICS) using the Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) as the external security manager. CICS, a Mainframe application, provides an interface between terminal users and application programs. The RACF credentials, with the addition of RACF groups, dictate what level of access users are given, based on their role and responsibilities.\nRACF password controls have been implemented that establish a mandatory password change upon initial login and after a specific number of days, minimum password length, and password history. User IDs are deactivated after a specific number of invalid login attempts. User accounts that have not been used within a specific time period are automatically deactivated.\nAn audit trail of operator and device activity is available to be generated from the Mainframe. The audit trail provides a record of Mainframe device access, configuration changes, and user actions and is used to research any questionable activity.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

It's ADP's priority to identify technology, environmental, process and health risks, and to mitigate the impact of business interruption resulting from a variety of potential events, including the loss of key facilities and resources. A Global Business Resiliency Policy and Program has been developed, in compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines, to establish a single global framework for how ADP manages, and controls identified risks resulting from disasters and other significant business disruptive events. ADP has created an integrated framework that lays out mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery processes.\nDisaster Recovery Planning\nDisaster Recovery plans are developed to recover and/or restore critical systems. Redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. Recovery times vary according to the criticality of the impacted system.\nThe Disaster Recovery plans are developed to:\n\u00b7 Provide an organized and consolidated approach to managing response and recovery activities following an unplanned incident or business interruption, to avoid confusion and to reduce exposure to error\n\u00b7 Provide prompt and appropriate response to any unplanned incident, thereby reducing the impacts resulting from service interruptions\n\u00b7 Recover essential Data Center operations in a timely manner, increasing ADP's ability to recover from a loss to a Data Center\nThe Disaster Recovery plans are designed to create a state of readiness that will provide response to any of the following incident scenarios at ADP Data Centers:\n\u00b7 Incidents causing physical damage such as fire, smoke, or water\n\u00b7 Incidents that indirectly affect Data Center facility access such as closure due to a storm, an emergency building evacuation due to a threat, or an external threat such as a fire to a nearby facility\n\u00b7 Impending or unexpected regional disasters such as an earthquake, hurricane, typhoon, or flood\n\u00b7 External incidents, which potentially could cause a service interruption, such as loss of electrical or telecommunication services\nThe Disaster Recovery plans are reviewed, revised, and tested annually. Various components may be subject to semi-annual or quarterly reviews and revisions.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Based on the results of a thorough Business Impact Analysis and Risk Threat Analysis\n\u00b7 Developed in conjunction with internal process owners\n\u00b7 Subjected to formal change control procedures\n\u00b7 Distributed to all individuals who would need them in case of an emergency\nThe Business Continuity plans are intended to provide prompt response and subsequent recovery from an unplanned business interruption, such as a loss of critical service, loss of building access or physical facility catastrophe. ADP's Business Continuity plans are focused on restoring specific services to clients.\nThe Business Continuity plans are required to be reviewed and revised at least annually, and various components may be subject to off-cycle reviews and revisions. A pre-planned walkthrough must be conducted annually, and an exercise (i.e., tabletop, simulation, integrated) must be conducted every two years.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Each user requires a unique user ID and password before access is granted to the network. In the US and Canada, ADP uses an IDM (Identity Management) system that automates the process of managers granting and revoking network access privileges for their direct reports. The process for provisioning and deprovisioning network access is initiated by HR either through direct notification or through the IDM system. The IDM system interfaces with AD to automatically create or disable the AD account.\nThe process for provisioning and deprovisioning ADP India associates' network access is initiated by HR. To obtain network access, a ticket is submitted to the ATM group. The ATM group grants network access to the new or transferred associate. For terminations and transfers out, management or HR submits a ticket to revoke access. The user account is disabled in AD by the system administrators in India and a ticket is submitted to ATM to remove the user account.\nFor ADP employees based in the Philippines, network access requests (for new hires and transfers in) are initiated by HR through a Service Desk ticket. A Service Desk ticket is then submitted to the System Administrators in the Philippines who grant network access.\nOS, Database, and Mainframe Access\nOnce network access is provisioned, associates can be given further access, including operating system, database, and Mainframe, based on their job responsibilities. Access is requested using the IDM system and requires proper approval by corresponding entitlement owners. If access is no longer needed, managers or entitlement owners submit a request to remove access using the IDM system. For terminated associates, request to remove access to operating systems, databases, and Mainframes is automatically submitted by the IDM system, which is either processed automatically via an interface or routed to the appropriate ADP group for processing.\nADP is in the process of transitioning to a new IDM system for access review and recertification. For systems that have been successfully migrated to the new tool, the LAT (Logical Access Team) team is responsible for coordinating the review of user listings based on a predefined review schedule. The review is initiated by the Campaign Owner using the IDM system. The IDM system sends email notifications to assigned reviewers and tracks their responses. Once the reviewers have validated their respective user listings, the campaign is finalized, and action is taken to modify user access where needed.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Ongoing risk assessments and management feedback are used to determine specific internal and external audit activities needed. Management designates personnel to monitor selected projects during design and implementation to consider their impact on the control environment before implementation.\nADP management and supervisory personnel monitor internal control performance quality as a normal part of their activities. To assist them with these monitoring activities, the organization has implemented a variety of activity and exception reports that measure the results of various processes involved in providing services to client organizations including processing volume and system availability reports as well as processing logs. Exceptions to normal or scheduled processing due to hardware, software, or procedural problems are logged, reported, and resolved daily. The appropriate levels of management review these reports daily and action is taken, as necessary.\nClient Satisfaction Monitoring\nSolution Center management communicates regularly with internal staff and clients to discuss issues and client satisfaction. Also, clients are surveyed after implementation, and annually thereafter, to determine client satisfaction with ongoing service delivery and products.\nInternal Audit Monitoring\nADP's business units are subject to periodic reviews by internal and external auditors. Internal auditor involvement may include, but is not limited to, gaining an understanding of, and evaluating:\n\u00b7 Management structure\n\u00b7 Systems development and programming\n\u00b7 Computer operations\n\u00b7 Physical and logical access\n\u00b7 Finance and accounting\nThe Internal Audit department issues are reported to the relevant ADP senior management stakeholder and if appropriate, the relevant business unit President and/or Chief Financial Officer.\nThird-Party Vendor Monitoring\nADP assesses, measures, monitors, and controls the risks associated with third parties through its Third-Party Risk Management program.

The network architecture is segregated into security zones using firewalls and other ACL constructs to restrict access to authorized network activity.\nConnections to the data centers from external networks are protected using encryption technologies. ADP associates working remotely use Virtual Private Network (VPN) via two-factor authentication.\nNetwork Detection and Response (NDR) systems are in place to monitor network activity. Global Network Services, under the Data Networks group, is responsible for the configuration of the network. Network equipment, including firewalls and other ACL constructs, are maintained and monitored by the Global Network Services group- If necessary, the Global Network Services personnel initiate corrective actions to resolve issues. Automated network and infrastructure monitoring tools are deployed to control and monitor the network and critical networking equipment. Issues are documented in Service Desk tickets.\nADP has developed a global infrastructure of security tools, referred to as T3. T3 globally integrates best-of- breed products to enable ADP to proactively monitor and identify potential security incidents or exposures. T3 captures billions of events daily (i.e., security logs, unusual network connections, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts, etc.), which are analyzed, correlated, and reviewed by the Critical Incident Response Center (CIRC).\nThe CIRC utilizes the Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) platform to track and report potential incidents that are created by the T3 infrastructure reported by associates, third parties, and/or clients. Archer supports both 'push' and 'pull' methods for incident creation, allowing for rapid triage and response to threats. Initial correlations of these incidents are performed by the various inputs into the SOAR platform where analysis and validation occur, and the results are memorialized in Archer and the security information data warehouse.\nInformation Security\nInformation security encompasses the controls that prevent and detect unauthorized access to information resources including physical access to facilities and logical access to information systems. The primary goal of information security is to restrict access to application programs, online transactions, and other computing resources to only authorized users.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Password restrictions are configured in compliance with corporate standards that include periodic forced password changes, password complexity, and password history.\nThe Privileged Identity Management (PIM) password vaulting utility is installed on servers hosted at the GETS North America hosting and data center facilities and is used to control the default local administrative accounts and enforce password changes. Access to the PIM password vaulting utility is governed by AD groups created on ADP's network. OS administrator access to the stand-alone servers is restricted to authorized personnel through vaulted accounts. Associates must initially login to ADP's network and then, if they belong to an authorized AD group, they can access the PIM password vaulting utility. Revoking access to the PIM password vaulting utility relies on the revocation of the underlying AD access or removal from the AD group granting access to the vaults. Only a limited number of authorized personnel, based on assigned job responsibilities, have privileged (administrator level) access to the PIM password vaulting utility.\nAuthentication and Security - Mainframe\nFor Mainframe, logical access is controlled through IBM's Customer Information Control System (CICS) using the Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) as the external security manager.

Patching is managed as part of the release management process by the Release Coordination group that uses automatic deployment technology to support quarterly patching cycles. Change Orders are submitted to authorize the deployment of the patches. The automated patch deployment technology analyzes the servers and applies relevant patches to each server, as needed, during the monthly or quarterly scheduled patching process.\nThe Distributed Systems group is also responsible for sending OS update notifications to other ADP groups responsible for installing the OS patches for servers located outside the GETS North America hosting and data center facilities and groups that opt out of the mass-patching process.\nOS software, hardware, and infrastructure changes are requested by the GETS North America or Product teams and submitted using the CA Service Desk tool (Service Desk). Service Desk hardware and infrastructure change requests go through predetermined workflow steps through to implementation that includes obtaining approval(s) from the designated department(s). OS software, hardware, and infrastructure changes are tested in a non- production environment and approved by the designated system owner and/or the Change Advisory Board (CAB) before deployment. Upon completion of workflow steps leading up to implementation and receipt of required approvals, changes are implemented in production based on the provided specifications.\nThe CAB consists of management representatives from various groups within the GETS North America organization. The CAB holds weekly change control meetings with operating units to review, discuss, and\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

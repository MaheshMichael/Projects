Payroll Input consists of payroll data related to an employee's current periodhours and/or earnings and Masterfile maintenance that is collected from the client into ADP-provided InputSystems or communicated directly to ADP for input by phone or fax. ADP processes payroll transactions usingthe client-provided input and generates a variety of standard and optional output reports (e.g., payroll registers,payroll summary), data files (e.g., money movement, direct deposit, general ledger files including files for NASADP GL and MAS GLI, iPay, and iReports files). Output reports and files are distributed to clients whenproduced. The following is a high-level overview of the payroll transaction flow:AutoPayClientsPhone / Fax /Road PayrollsiPay/PCPWEnterprise HR AutoLink/ MarketplaceSelf Service Portal1Self Service Portal/PayForceConsumed byVantage, Enterprise, WFN, LifionLifion/Vantage/WFNAutoPayEPCMQSeriesInfolinkPTCSEDITNETTurbo APIKeyFastMQSeriesRTP SOAP APIDatapoolWRAPClient OutputsiReports/ iPayPaychecksVouchersfilesMoneyGeneralPrintedInfolink /MovementLedger filesreportsMQSeriesfilesto clientNAS ADPGL andMAS GLIfilesThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.36Always Designingfor People"Payroll InputDatapoolDatapool, a component of the AutoPay Application, is the central repository for data received from any of theInput Systems. Data is held in Datapool until it is ready for processing. Datapool imports and retains informationto be processed by the AutoPay Application until polled by the PTCS. Once polled, the data is submitted to thenext processing phase of the AutoPay Application.The AutoPay Application receives client data input from two primary input methods:· Automated Input (primary method) - Clients can use one of several ADP-supplied Input Systems, such asEnterprise, PayForce, iPay, or Self-Service Portal. Input Systems can be hosted by ADP or installed at aclient site (i.e., premised-based systems). Premised-based systems are optional and not in the scope ofthis Description.· Manual Input (secondary method - a small percentage of clients) -o Clients communicate payroll data to ADP over the phone or send completed system-generatedstandard forms that contain payroll data via fax or courier.o ADP Data Entry (Teledata) operators manually enter the payroll information into the AutoPayApplication for processing.Automated InputClients use the Input Systems to enter and transmit their payroll transactions which are then automaticallytransmitted to ADP's AutoPay Application for processing. This enables clients to enter and validate transactionsand provides them with more control over entering payroll information. When clients use the Input Systems, thetransactions are transmitted to AutoPay for processing through one of the following communication systems:ADP's EPC or Infolink, or the MQSeries file-transfer system. These communication systems run on ADP's localarea network (LAN) and periodically communicate with the Mainframe's Datapool component through automaticinterfaces. Built-in security features (e.g., encryption, user IDs, and passwords) enable clients to maintain theconfidentiality of sensitive employee information. The Input Systems also promote efficient data entry by usingedit checks that are applied when data is input. The edit checks also improve the accuracy of payroll data inputbefore being transmitted to the AutoPay Application for processing.Each of the Input Systems allows the client to enter payroll data on an ongoing basis, as information becomesavailable, enabling data entry flexibility. The data is accumulated within the Input Systems, validated by theclient, and held until the client elects to submit it for processing. Upon client submission, the data isautomatically transmitted by the communication systems to the AutoPay Application for processing. The datacan be recalled by the client from the Input Systems and edited at any time in the Input Systems beforeThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

The communication systems receive the data throughout the day and periodically transfers it intoDatapool where it is held until processed.Manual InputAutoPay Payroll Services clients can also submit payroll transactions directly to ADP Teledata operators byphone. Some regions can receive client payroll information by fax.Daily, Teledata operators review online call and fax lists. The call list contains the clients whose payroll inputmust be obtained that day. A Teledata operator calls the client contact at a pre-arranged time and obtains thepayroll information needed for input. In some regions, clients can call the Teledata operators directly. The callermust provide information that identifies them as an authorized Teledata client. The Teledata operator keys thepayroll information into the Key-Fast system (a component of the AutoPay Application), which performs apreliminary data verification known as "editing" that includes validations against various control databases. Pagetotals are verified with the client to verify that data is keyed accurately. Input received from Key-Fast istransferred to Datapool where it is held until processed.Statutory (STAT) File MaintenanceThe AutoPay development team currently leverages the Agile methodology to develop and complete AutoPaySTAT File Maintenance changes. The specifics of this Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method aredescribed in the following sections.The AutoPay Application tax-withholding rate modules are maintained in the STAT File database. The STATFile database feeds the AutoPay statutory and quarter/year-end modules and is used during payroll processing fortax rate information based on client company code and employee number.The Payroll Statutory Kanban team maintains the STAT File database. Statutory Research Shared Servicespersonnel make ongoing inquiries about, and obtain statutory information concerning, requirements and pendingand enacted legislation that can impact the following payroll tax issues, some of which, but not all, are housed inthe STAT File database: tax withholding calculations, quarter and year-end forms, fringe benefits, magneticmedia/electronic-filing specifications, new-product statutory requirement, wage garnishments, new hire reporting,state unemployment wages, and taxability rules.Statutory Research Shared Services monitors statutory changes for payroll-related taxes for both U.S. andCanadian taxing authorities at the following levels: federal, state, local (city) and county, Canadian provinces andterritories, and U.S. territories and commonwealths. In conducting statutory research, the Statutory ResearchShared Services group uses contacts, and maintains evidence of each contact for tracking purposes, at relevantgovernment agencies, various online and hard-copy publications, relevant Internet websites, Internal RevenueThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

The Statutory Project Manager then creates a "Development" tracking item,which is assigned to a Business Analyst on the Payroll Statutory Kanban team. The Business Analyst isresponsible for prioritizing, analyzing, and scheduling the statutory item, based upon the effective date of thestatutory change. Identifying the AutoPay Application impacts (e.g., STAT File, quarter, client, region), andcreating "Narratives" to be used for further research and development of the proposed change, is also theresponsibility of the business analyst.Each narrative has a developer, tester, and documentation specialist assigned. Elaboration sessions are held toreview the narrative's content and apply revisions as needed. The assigned business analyst, developer, tester,and documentation specialist participate in elaboration. After elaboration is complete, development occurs,followed by testing and certification. Certification and acceptance of the statutory change by the Payroll StatutoryKanban team tester signifies that the STAT File database updates are ready for deployment. The PayrollStatutory Kanban team's Scrum Master holds daily meetings to discuss the status of each feature and narrative.The status is tracked using tracking software.The Statutory Project Manager holds a weekly tracking meeting to discuss the status of time-sensitive openstatutory changes not yet released to the regions. A point-in-time tracking report lists open tracking items, and theWIP report that lists potential, or work-in-progress statutory items monitored by the Statutory Research SharedServices Group, are reviewed during the tracking meeting.Statutory changes are implemented based on the details provided in the tracking item and narrative. For changesthat do not require code modifications, the STAT File database updates are entered directly in the STAT Filedatabase. For changes requiring coding modifications, these follow the standard change management processdescribed in the General Computer Controls section of this Description.Updates requiring coding modifications are coded and tested by either the Payroll Statutory Kanban team ordesignated AutoPay Scrum teams. Both teams certify and "accept" changes signifying they are ready for releaseto the AutoPay Application production environment. The process and controls for releasing changes follow theChange Management process described in the General Computer Controls section of this Description.Logical access to the STAT File database is limited to authorized personnel who log in using their Mainframeuser ID and password. The process and controls for STAT File database access follow the Logical Securityprocess described in the General Computer Controls section of this Description.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.39@Always Designingfor People"Payroll ProcessingProcessing is divided into two phases: EDIT and NET/CALC. ADP uses the AutoPay Application's PTCS totrack, control, and monitor the results of each processing phase. PTCS controls the processing of data fromDatapool through NET/CALC processing. Using online screens, individual Regions can define processingparameters based on their individual requirements, including the length of time data can accumulate before beingtransferred to the next processing phase. PTCS provides online inquiries to track the status of the individualpayrolls that are being processed by the AutoPay Application. PTCS also provides online control totals and dailyproduction statistics that are used to track and monitor AutoPay Application processing activities.EDIT ProcessingEDIT is an AutoPay Application program, managed by PTCS, that automatically collects and processes payrolldata received from Datapool.During EDIT processing, the program automatically compares the payroll data received from Datapool with theEMP to verify information such as employee numbers. Four error levels are used to evaluate the comparison:1) Syntactical; 2) Relational I; 3) Relational II, and 4) Relational III. Syntactical checks verify syntax forpropriety. These relational levels provide more detailed edit checking based on error complexity. The rules arestored in the Batch Edit Rule Database and changes follow the ADP change management process. The EDITprogram then flags payroll data as Ready for Edit, Ready for NET/CALC, Error, and Ready for Reprocessing.The Editing Group reviews payroll data flagged as 'Error' and if they cannot correct the error, the Client ServicesGroup is notified. The Client Services Group then contacts the client to resolve the error. The Editing Groupmay contact clients directly to resolve errors.Once EDIT errors are corrected, the program communicates the payroll data status to PTCS as 'Ready forNET/CALC' and the next processing phase, NET/CALC, starts.The EDIT processing phase produces one output from the CUI database file. This file maintains payrollinformation on a company level and is used to support the NET/CALC process and remains on the AutoPayApplication for a defined amount of time as specified by the individual region. The CUI information is retainedso the region can rerun a payroll if necessary.NET/CALC ProcessingPTCS moves client payrolls flagged as Ready for NET/CALC processing from the CUI database file intoNET/CALC. Once moved, the NET/CALC processing phase calculates the current payroll and updates the EMPbased on client-defined payroll schedules. Payrolls requiring immediate processing are referred to as "Hot"payrolls and can be flagged by ADP's PTCS personnel to prioritize their processing.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.40@Always Designingfor People"The NET/CALC processing phase uses client options that reside in the CCI database to determine how variableroutines such as calculating gross earnings, providing credit for vacation, holiday, and sick time, taking voluntarydeductions and other such matters are to be handled. Clients are responsible for providing the data used toconfigure their options in CCI upon implementation and for communicating updates to those options to ADP in atimely manner.If a client submits changes for company or EMP items, the changes replace the previous EMP entries. TheNET/CALC process takes the input data for each employee, refers to the EMP record for items such as theemployee's earnings rate, tax status, and authorized deductions, and calculates the gross earnings, voluntarydeductions, and net pay. The STAT File houses tax rate and formula information. Using AutoPay's Statutorydatabase (STAT File) NET/CALC calculates taxes and year-to-date balances for gross earnings, federal, state, andlocal income tax, social security deductions, and goal amounts. The NET/CALC process reformats the AutoPayApplication data into a readable format that is ready for additional processing during the WRAP processing phase.Monitoring of Processing ActivitiesThe GETS Organization and the GETS Command Center staff use automated tools to continuously monitor thestatus of the scheduled jobs (e.g., transmissions, NET/CALC, and EDIT jobs) and to alert the staff about jobfailures. This process is covered as part of the ADP GET US Organization SOC 1 Report.OutputWRAP ProcessingUpon completion of the NET/CALC process, the WRAP process is kicked off to produce multiple outputs. Theprimary AutoPay Application outputs are categorized into one of the following: Pay Statements, Reports (printedand electronic), and Data Files (e.g., files for other ADP systems, Money Movement/Direct Deposit Files).Turbo Output APITurbo API (Application Programming Interface) returns detailed results of the payroll to other ADP systems, likeEnterprise, Next Gen HCM, Vantage, and Workforce Now. The data consists of payroll summary and employeepay details, including deductions, earnings, taxes as well as regular and year to date accumulators.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.41Always Designingfor People"Pay StatementsAutoPay Application outputs, categorized as pay statements, which are physically printed and distributed toclients are:· Checks (including ADPChecks): Printed with the net paid amount preceded with asterisks. The earningsstatement provides a comprehensive record showing the elements of gross pay (e.g., hours and rate),payroll taxes and deductions, and year-to-date totals. Company check control totals are provided to verifythe number of checks issued, the first and last check numbers used, and the total dollar amount of thechecks printed.· Vouchers: Similar to checks in both information content and control procedures. Vouchers are producedfor employees who elect direct deposit. "Non-Negotiable" and "This Is Not A Check" are clearlyindicated on the voucher.· Non-Negotiable Laser Check: A voucher-like notification provided to employers who pay theiremployees in cash. The document provides the employees with a net-pay amount and a comprehensiveearnings statement.Design characteristics in ADP's payroll checks and stubs provide security protection against color copy andscanner duplication systems. The checks include an intricate encoding pattern within high-resolution borders thatbecome distorted when duplicated. Also, the background of the checks uses a multi-tone shade over a cascadingbuilding block design (prismatic printing) that is difficult to accurately reproduce, and the shading accentuates theword "VOID" when the check is copied. On the reverse side of the check, a unique printing pattern of multi-width lines embedded with encoding marks has been added to protect the document from scanner duplication. Inaddition, ADP's check design uses several sophisticated features that include:· Thermochromic ink that provides a heat-sensitive ADP logo and ADP watermark to verify theauthenticity· A unique control number on pre-numbered check stock that uses special ink to improve trackingChecks are produced on laser printers with a Graphics Handling Option. If a paper jam occurs during checkprinting, most printers reject damaged checks and continue to print where the jam occurred, and the printer noteswhere the error occurred. Operators visually scan the jam point for proper sequencing, possible duplication, oradditional damage. Rejected checks are subsequently moved to a holding area. The printer reprints the checksthat the operator removed from the jam point. Other printers automatically insert a pink sheet of paper at thepoint where the paper jam occurred. The operator removes the damaged checks from the printer paper path andthe printer automatically reprints the checks that the operator removed and marks the point of duplication with apink sheet. Some Regions use Quality Assurance (QA) to inspect the laser-printed paper sheets both precedingand following the inserted pink sheet of paper to identify any duplicate checks.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.42Always Designingfor People"For clients that have requested to have checks and vouchers stuffed in envelopes, the operators use envelope-stuffing machines. Checks that are not stuffed inside envelopes are wrapped in rubber bands and forwarded to theProcessing Support Organization.The envelope-stuffing machines provide a total count of the number of envelopes stuffed and detect checks thatare duplicates or out-of-sequence. Each check and voucher page have an encoded page number. Some regionsincorporate additional parity checks to verify odd and even sequences. Two sequential odd or even checksindicate a potential error. Operators review identified error messages and resolve identified issues promptly. Ifchecks are damaged during the printing or stuffing process, the operators deface or destroy the checks in acontrolled manner. Operators maintain a record of damaged checks that is forwarded to QA and/or bankingpersonnel to alert them of potential duplicate or missing checks.Quality Control personnel review payroll reports checks and vouchers for defects as they package them fordelivery. Quality Control personnel are restricted from having access to modify the pay statements within theAutoPay Application and Operations Center System. If QA personnel discover a problem with a printed payroll(e.g., wrinkling, tears, or smudges), a rerun, or reprint, may be scheduled.ReportsEach region is responsible for setting up and maintaining clients' reporting requirements and schedules. Reportscan be printed or made available electronically in PDF format, depending on client requirements.

The trackingtool provides printed output and media distribution process visibility using a web-based software package, as wellas uses multi-vendor interfaces and delivery-management tools to support the service delivery environment.Clients are responsible for notifying ADP of any issues with the delivery of printed reports.Data FilesUpon successful completion of a payroll run, the AutoPay Application automatically produces a series of payrolldata files that are either used by other ADP systems or transmitted back to the input systems for client access andviewing. The primary data files consist of:· Other Payroll Related Files - These output files consist of electronic payroll registers, year-to-date, AMC,and any other custom client reports that are transmitted from AutoPay to the Input Systems for clients toview, download, and/or print.· NAS ADP GL and MAS GLI Files - These output files contain payroll data in a pre-formatted generalledger file that is transmitted to ADP's NAS ADP GL or the MAS GLI products using MQSeriesmiddleware.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.44@Always Designingfor People"ADP ReportingClients have the option of electing ADP Reporting (ADPR) which is an integrated solution allowing clients tocreate custom, sample, standard, compare and data extract report types. ADPR can pull data into these reportsfrom multiple products allowing clients to integrate reporting functionality. ADPR houses meta data that theclient can select to design the reports and business rules for pulling data from products used by the clientincluding payroll (AutoPay), Benefits (HWSE) or from HCM products such as Workforce Now or Vantage,amongst other options.Money Movement/Direct Deposit FilesThe AutoPay Application produces money movement and direct deposit files and transmits them for clients thathave elected FSDD, or a regular Direct Deposit option as follows:· Traditional Banking: Offers transmission to financial institutions or bank service processors. Regulardirect deposit information is transmitted directly to individual banks via an Automated Clearing House(ACH) transfer.· Money Movement: Offers transmission to ADP's TotalPay service for FSDD and ADPCheckinformation is transmitted to partner banks. ADPChecks are printed in the regions.Transmission to Traditional BankingUpon completion of payroll processing, the direct deposit payment information is written to a separate file andstored for transmission to the appropriate recipient for clients who use the regular direct deposit service. Regulardirect deposit information is transmitted primarily to banks. For ADP clients that elect regular direct deposit,client management is responsible for completing their agreements and authorizations with their individual banksand providing the required banking information to ADP.· Setup - The Data Transmission team receives daily reports indicating which payrolls have run and whichare awaiting transmission to a specific bank. Banks can receive or retrieve direct deposit files from ADP.The status of bank transmissions is reviewed daily. The review is done via phone or Voice Response Unit(VRU) for each bank, as required, to support direct deposit transmissions.· Security - Files can be transmitted via MFT (Managed File Transfer) with the options including FTP withfile encryption or via SFTP depending on the particular bank's requirements. Many banks log into ADP'ssystem for authentication purposes before establishing a session. After the transmission, ADPsystematically indicates that a file transmission was completed successfully.· Confirmation - The Data Transmission team confirms by telephone, VRU, email or fax, (depending onarrangements made with the bank) whether the bank's total number of payments and the total monetaryamount of the debits and credits received agree with ADP's totals, and records that the transmission wasconfirmed. Unsuccessful transmissions are re-transmitted until correct before being processed by thebank.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.45Always Designingfor People"Transmission to Money MovementClients electing FSDD services must complete an authorization form (e.g., the "Client Account Agreement") thatis reviewed and approved by ADP and authorizes the payroll data files to be transmitted.ADP reviews and approves these forms. ADP creates the National Automated Clearing House Association(NACHA) master file information and upon bank approval of the NACHA transmissions, clients and theiremployees may wait for a specified period of time known as a pre-notification (pre-note) period before the directdeposit process is activated.For clients electing FSDD, the AutoPay Application automatically generates money movement files and transmitsthem to ADP's TotalPay service. The Data Transmission team will review the transmission status several timesthroughout the day and compare the information available to confirm transmissions were processed successfullyand to identify any exceptions. Identified discrepancies are followed to resolution.The TotalPay process and controls are not in the scope of this report and are covered in ADP's TotalPay ServicesSystem and TotalPay and Wisely Services System SOC 1 reports.Data Transmission MonitoringThe following groups monitor the status of data transmissions to check for the completion of the transmission anddistribution of the output:· GETS - Various support teams within ADP's GETS organization support the monitoring of datatransmissions between ADP systems and entities.· ADP payroll Regions - Business support teams monitor transmission to AutoPay from productionapplications. ADP will work with the client if necessary to resolve any issues related to the filetransmission.· Data Transmissions - the Data Transmissions team monitors the status of money movement transmissionsand direct deposit files from the AutoPay Application to ADP's TotalPay system.These groups document identified issues in problem management systems, documenting issues as needed and takeaction to resolve identified issues promptly.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.51@Always Designingfor People"Agile CeremoniesSprint Planning MeetingAt the beginning of each Sprint, the Product Owner and Scrum Development Team hold a Sprint PlanningMeeting to negotiate which Product Backlog items they will attempt to convert to the working product during theSprint. The Product Owner is responsible for declaring which items are the most important to the business(Minimum Viable Product - MVP). The Scrum Development Team is responsible for selecting the amount ofwork to implement without accruing technical debt.Daily Scrum and Sprint ExecutionEvery day, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Scrum Development Team members spend a total of 15 to30 minutes reporting to each other. During each meeting, Scrum Development Team members summarize theprevious days' work and the current days' work, as well as what impediments exist. During Sprint execution, theScrum Development Team defines, develops, and reviews system requirements to produce an MVP. BusinessUser Stories, written by the Product Owner, contain requirements. Scrum Development Team members writetechnical User Stories, which also support the MVP. The structure for the hardware, software, and datasupporting the requirements is determined and developed. The Scrum Development Team plans for systemimplementation, testing, documentation, and training. The Scrum Development Team designs, codes, tests, anddocuments programs and conversion programs. The team uses automated, repeatable tests to help ensure codeintegrity throughout the sprint iterations. The ChangeMan Version Control System is used to control and monitorsource code. The Scrum Development Team maintains current Sprint metrics. Organizational impediments areimpediments that are issues beyond the Scrum Development Team's control. ADP Management resolvesorganizational impediments at the appropriate management level.Sprint Review MeetingAt the end of the sprint, the Scrum Development Team holds a review meeting to demonstrate a working productincrement to the product owner and stakeholders. The meeting features a live demonstration. It is the opportunityto inspect and adapt the product as it emerges, and iteratively refine the understanding of the requirements.Sprint Retrospective MeetingAfter a Sprint ends, the Scrum Development Team attends a retrospective meeting to reflect on its own process.They inspect their behavior and take action to adapt it for future Sprints. The goal is to gain a commonunderstanding of multiple perspectives and to develop actions that will take the team and the organization tomaturity.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

During this meeting,the team estimates the amount of effort they would expend to complete items in the Product Backlog and provideother technical information to help the Product Owner prioritize them.Documentation (performed in parallel with Scrum and Kanban)While the Scrum Development Team is completing tasks, a UX (User Experience) Content team memberdevelops documentation to accompany the release. The documentation includes highlights of the release, newfeature information, descriptions of product changes, new or revised procedures or processes, help updates, andinstallation instructions.Documentation developed by the UX Content team is available to the regions via an internal documentationwebsite. Documentation updates are posted to the website for Pilot and General Release phases when code isreleased.The Payroll Support Group Issues Information Board bulletins that provide additional information about updatesor changes released previously and Program Problem Notifications that alert the regions and GETS NorthAmerica Organization of problems they may encounter and temporary solutions for these problems.Release Hardening, iAT, Pilot, General Release:Release Hardening PhaseAfter the Product Owner has accepted the user stories as meeting acceptance criteria for the Minimum ViableProduct, the Release is ready and approved for hardening. During hardening, the release code is frozen, and nonew functionality is developed. A customized System Test Plan is created, and documentation is reviewed andfinalized. Minimum Viable Product testing verifies that the change accurately produces the desired results.Continuous Integration Testing verifies full system, end-to-end, and input-to-output functionality. Regressiontesting captures information about a test payroll-processing environment before and after installing the release toensure existing functionality is uncompromised. Performance testing occurs in an environment that mirrors aregion's production environment. This is to record the installation time and to benchmark system performancebefore and after the release installation, and activation of new features. AutoPay development uses benchmarkinginformation for capacity planning purposes.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.53Always Designingfor People"iAT PhaseiAT testing replicates the testing that was originally performed by AutoPay development testers but uses a morerobust regional-level test base. Performance testing is performed again at this phase. Tasks include installing theentire release for the first time, complete end-to-end testing including input-to-output functionality, and standardpayroll certification for both the U.S. and Canada.The iAT Group performs a final review of the installation procedures and release documents and conducts aturnover meeting with the GETS North America Organization handling the release.Pilot PhaseAs part of the Pilot Phase, the AutoPay Application releases/changes are installed and run on one or more RegionLPARs to monitor performance. The GETS North America Organization has an Implementation Guidedocumenting the installation process and along with AutoPay development groups provide technical support tothe pilot region. Feedback from the pilot region LPARs drives modifications to programs, documentation, ortraining procedures.General Release PhaseUpon successful completion of the iAT and/or Pilot phases, the GETS North America Organization sends anannouncement authorizing deployment to ADP's production environment. Upon receipt of the deploymentauthorization, the AutoPay development testers and Payroll Support group make the program changes available tothe production environment. Once the release code has been made available to the production environment, theAutoPay Delivery, Service, and Support group announces that the release is available for deployment to theproduction environment. Upon receipt of this communication, authorized members of the GETS North AmericaOrganization move certified code to the baseline environment, the approved code master repository.The GETS North America Organization uses the Control M Scheduling System to schedule the migration of theapplication code into the production environment. The GETS Command Center will perform backups beforeinstallation. The final step of each application release is to send out an information message confirming asuccessful installation. The message is sent to the applicable Corporate, GETS North America Organizationincluding the GETS Command Center personnel. The Release Management Group monitors the installationprocess on AutoPay Application LPARs to support the timely and complete installation of releases or changes.This process helps ensure that responsibilities are segregated between the development group and the GETSNorth America Organization, who are responsible for migrating changes into the production environment.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. ADP, the ADP logo and Always Designingfor People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.54Always Designingfor People"Authorized UX Content personnel post the release documentation developed by the UX Content team to theinternal documentation website. The Corporate Field Support Group provides technical support during complexproduct/system enhancements and rollouts.Minor AutoPay Application changes, such as patches, emergency changes, break fixes, standard report changes,and statutory (STAT File) releases, are packaged into smaller releases that must also go through a pilot phase.The AutoPay development tester moves Patch and STAT File Release updates to the baseline environmentindicating that testing is complete. Only a limited number of authorized personnel, primarily members of theAutoPay Delivery, Service and Support, or the Payroll Support group, can make Patch and STAT File releasesavailable to the AutoPay Application production environment. Similar to the process for major changes, ADPstaff use the Control M Scheduling System to schedule the application code for installation to the productionenvironment.Mainframe - Access to Source CodeSource code is controlled using the ChangeMan version control system and the ability to migrate code to theAutoPay Application production environment is restricted to authorized personnel and excludes those responsiblefor development functions. This control is covered in the ADP GETS North America SOC 1 Report.Input/Output Systems Development and Change ManagementChanges to the Input/Output Systems consist of major releases, break fixes, minor enhancements, configurationchanges, report changes, or emergency changes. Changes are governed by the respective product owner and/orbusiness unit management responsible for the Input/Output Systems. Authorized developers use a source coderepository to commit and track code over the development lifecycle.Requests for changes occur from internal sources or from external clients and are reviewed by each product ownerand business unit management and prioritized according to client demand and internal objectives. Once reviewed,change authorizations are provided by the product owner and/or business unit management through email orduring change review meetings and documented through meeting minutes. Authorized changes are then assignedto a project manager and a development team to make any required coding changes.Segregated development and test environments from the production environment exist for each of theInput/Output Systems. Upon completion of development, testing of changes commences and is performed by theAutoPay development testers and iAT group. These groups are responsible for creating test plans, executing thetesting, and reviewing the test results following a similar process as described above. If the results aresatisfactory, testers and iAT members will email the respective project manager, product owner, and/or businessunit management for the Input/Output System certifying that the change is ready for production. The projectmanager then reviews and approves the changes for release to production by submitting a change order.This report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of itsclients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

The Control Objectives and controls included in the Description are those that management of State Street believes are likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting, and the Description does not include those aspects of the System that are not likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Description indicates that certain Control Objectives can be achieved only if complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of State Street's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with related controls at the service organization. Our examination did not extend to such complementary user entity controls, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary user entity controls.\nState Street uses Duco, a third party subservice organization, as defined in the accompanying Section III A8 Subservice Organizations, to perform certain reconciliations that are relevant to client's internal controls over financial reporting. The Description includes only the Control Objectives and related controls of State Street and excludes the control objectives and related controls of Duco. The description also indicates that certain Control Objectives specified by State Street can be achieved only if complementary subservice organization controls assumed in the design of State Street's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with the related controls at State Street. Our examination did not extend to such complementary controls of Duco, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.\nThe System uses information technology infrastructure support, centrally-managed information technology services and related controls provided by State Street's Information Technology and Global Security divisions (collectively, the \"Component Subservice Organization\"), a component of State Street.

Our examination was also performed in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, based on the criteria in management's Assertion, the Description is fairly presented, and the controls were suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related Control Objectives throughout the period October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023.

State Street's operations are organized into two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided. The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry.\nInvestment Servicing, through State Street Investment Services, State Street Global Markets and State Street Alpha, provides investment services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide. Products include: back office products such as custody, accounting, regulatory reporting, investor services, performance and analytics; middle office products such as investment book of record, transaction management, loans, cash, derivatives and collateral services, record keeping, client reporting and investment analytics; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; financial data management to support institutional investors; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance, including Prime Services products; and deposit and short-term investment facilities.\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients through State Street Global Advisors.

The Standard of Conduct is described further in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Corporate Compliance.\nRegulatory Environment\nAs described above in the Regulation section of this overview, State Street is a highly regulated entity subject to reporting obligations to, and examinations by, federal and state regulatory agencies in the U.S. and local regulatory agencies in the international jurisdictions in which State Street operates.\nControl Environment\nMany of State Street's controls detailed within this report contribute to the prevention of fraud. For example, State Street's Funds Transfer and Transaction Origination Policy (\"FTTOP\") described in this report requires that a transaction originator's identity and transaction authority be verified upon receipt of trade instructions and requests to transfer funds. State Street's controls surrounding Anti-Money Laundering, Know Your Customer (\"KYC\") and Identity Theft Prevention also contribute to the prevention of fraud. Additionally, each of the support divisions and areas described in Section III A3 of this overview contribute to State Street's policies designed to prevent fraud.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 11",

As administrator or sub-administrator, State Street, under the direction and supervision of fund management and counsel, may prepare financial statements and may be responsible for coordination with fund management with respect to expense accruals and adjustments. Controls surrounding the preparation of draft shareholder reports in the United States are described in Sections III B and IV A of this report.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nWhen requested by clients and to the extent State Street can do so, State Street provides sub-certifications to clients in connection with services provided by State Street to those clients in furtherance of their compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 certification requirements. Such sub-certifications generally address (i) material changes and corrective actions with respect to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the internal controls described in the most recent Global Fund Accounting and Custody SOC 1\u00ae report, as well as (ii) instances of fraud involving State Street management or other individuals responsible for the internal controls described in the Global Fund Accounting and Custody SOC 1\u00ae report that have not been previously reported to clients.\nFinancial Crimes Compliance\nState Street and its subsidiaries are committed to combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financial activity (collectively referred to as \"financial crime\") and complying fully with all applicable laws and regulations designed to combat financial crime in the jurisdictions in which it does business. State Street is also committed to complying with all sanctions that are legally binding on it and its business across all of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nState Street has appointed a Global Head of Financial Crimes Compliance Officer who leads a team of employees with experience in this area to oversee State Street's Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions compliance program (the \"Global AML and Sanctions Program\" or the \"Global Program\"). State Street's Global AML and Sanctions Program is comprised of written anti-money laundering and sanctions policies, standards, procedures, internal controls and systems, which include but are not limited to the following: a customer identification program and procedures; procedures to collect and update, as appropriate, customer due diligence information; screening of customer and transactions against sanctions and other watch lists; processes to assess money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks at the program, customer and product levels; processes and systems to monitor customer transactions and activity; processes and systems to identify and report suspicious activity; training of employees on AML and sanctions requirements; processes to retain required records; and regular independent testing conducted by Corporate Audit.\nThe Global AML and Sanctions Program is periodically evaluated, updated and enhanced in order to reflect changes to State Street business activities, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable supervisory standards and legal requirements.

The following policies are approved by the Core Compliance and Ethics Committee and the Global Financial Crimes Committee: Fraud Risk Management Policy; Global Gifts and Entertainment Policy; Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy; and Global Political Contributions and Activities Policy.\nRisk Assessment\nState Street has established a robust risk assessment process to identify and evaluate the full scale and scope of its exposures, to analyze how its business activities might evolve as economic and market conditions change, and to help ensure that State Street is operating within the risk appetite defined by the Board of Directors. The Material Risk Identification (\"MRI\") Process is one of State Street's primary risk identification programs and utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify State Street's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off- balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational/technology, fiduciary, business, reputational, and regulatory risks. The primary output from the program is a firm-wide Material Risk Inventory, which is a comprehensive list of the risks that could significantly impact State Street, irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. The material risks are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors on an annual basis to ensure that significant changes to State Street's risk profile are captured on a timely basis. In addition, the quarterly MRI updates focus on identifying emerging risks and triggering events that could cause State Street's exposures to materialize. The Material Risk Inventory forms a holistic view of State Street's risk profile and is used as a foundational element in State Street's risk management and capital planning processes. ERM, and State Street's control functions more broadly, are responsible for providing review and challenge during the risk identification process to ensure that they are effectively capturing all key risks to which the business is exposed.\nMonitoring\nState Street management is responsible for continuously monitoring risk exposure across the company and assessing the design and operating effectiveness of its controls. The monitoring process is accomplished through a variety of ongoing activities, including risk monitoring activities performed by the First and Second Lines of Defense (described in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure), operational event reporting, credit exposure reporting, key risk and performance indicator reporting, and consolidated risk reporting to senior management, oversight committees and the Board of Directors. Management also reviews the results of separate evaluations performed by regulators and Corporate Audit and takes appropriate action to remediate any identified issues. State Street's Board of Directors and senior management provide overall oversight and management review of operating performance. State Street employs a three lines of defense model in which risk management is a shared responsibility among all lines of defense. Refer to the description of the three lines of defense in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Enterprise Risk Management for further details on State Street's approach to risk management and the related responsibilities.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n13",

        "content": "GLOBAL FUND ACCOUNTING AND CUSTODY\nThird-Party Risk Management\nState Street leverages and relies on third-party providers for products and services to support its operations, services and initiatives. \"Third-Party Provider\" is broadly defined as any entity that has entered into a contractual relationship with State Street to support its business functions and activities. While using third- party services assists in obtaining necessary expertise, expanding product offerings, improving services and managing cost, it also introduces potential risks inherent with involvement of a third-party provider. Such risks need to be assessed prior to engaging with the third party and requires ongoing monitoring and management throughout the lifecycle of a third-party engagement. As a result, State Street has implemented a Third-Party Risk Management (\"TPRM\") program for assessing and managing risks associated with the use of third-party products and services throughout the engagement lifecycle in a manner consistent with compliance and regulatory requirements.\nTPRM is managed within a governance structure that includes oversight from State Street's Board of Directors including the Technology and Operations Risk Committee, the Third Party and Outsourcing Risk Committee, and the three lines of defense as detailed in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Enterprise Risk Management. TPRM begins with an Inherent Risk Questionnaire (\"IRQ\"), which must be completed by the Business Unit Manager engaging the third party. The IRQ measures the level of inherent risk within a State Street function that is looking to leverage the products or services of a third party to support its business activities. Both the inherent risk rating for the product or service as well as the required due diligence to be performed on the proposed third party are driven by the level of inherent risk determined through the IRQ. The due diligence process includes a series of control review programs, which are completed by the third party to provide visibility on the design of the third party's controls prior to contracting. The program has defined an ongoing monitoring program. The level of inherent risk determines the timeframe for re-assessment, including annual review and update of the IRQ, or whenever there are significant changes to the scope of products or services . Scheduled updates to control reviews with the third party occur on a frequency based on the level of inherent risk.\n3. State Street Governance and Structure\nState Street's approach to risk management involves all levels of management, from the Board of Directors and its committees, including the Risk Committee, the Examining and Audit Committee, the Human Resource Committee, and the Technology and Operations Committee, to each business unit and each employee. Responsibility for risk oversight is allocated so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. Risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through a three lines of defense framework.\n1. The First Line of Defense: The business and functional units who perform day-to-day operational and/or support activities that may give rise to risk operate as the First Line of Defense (\"FLOD\"). The FLOD owns the risks associated with their activities and is responsible for establishing effective internal controls to manage such risks to an acceptable level and promoting a strong culture of risk awareness.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION I\n14",

The Second Line of Defense: Control functions independent of the FLOD, such as Enterprise Risk Management and Corporate Compliance, operate as the Second Line of Defense (\"SLOD\"). The SLOD is responsible for setting the corporate risk appetite limits, developing policies and procedures to evaluate whether risks remain within the appropriate limits, monitoring risk-taking, and providing credible review and challenge to the FLOD risk management practices. Refer to additional details in Enterprise Risk Management and Corporate Compliance sections below.\n3. The Third Line of Defense: Corporate Audit operates as the independent Third Line of Defense (\"TLOD\"). The TLOD is responsible for assessing the effectiveness of the First and Second Lines of Defense as it relates to managing risk and providing reporting to the Board of Directors and management. Refer to additional details in the Corporate Audit section below.\nEnterprise Risk Management\nThe Chief Risk Officer leads ERM globally and has a dual reporting line directly to State Street's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer is also a member of the Executive Committee, the Firm's most senior policy-making committee.\nAs part of its mandate, ERM maintains the Firm's Risk Appetite Framework, including the supporting risk policies and limits, that sets boundaries for firm-wide risk-taking and ensures business strategy, risk processes, and controls contain risk within acceptable bounds. To support this Risk Appetite Framework, ERM has implemented a comprehensive governance structure that provides focused oversight of material risks, establishes corporate risk guidelines and provides a formal mechanism to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of risk. In fulfilling its monitoring and oversight responsibilities, ERM is responsible for proactively monitoring firm-wide risk-taking and has established regular processes for reporting on top risk exposures and emerging risk issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. In addition, ERM is responsible for developing, or ensuring the integrity of, the risk measurement methodologies and tools that are used to monitor the Firm's risk profile relative to its risk appetite. In situations where a material exposure is at risk of breaching the Firm's risk appetite, ERM is charged with taking the actions it deems appropriate to mitigate or reduce the potential impact to the Firm's earnings, capital or reputation. In the event of a risk appetite breach, ERM has established a formal escalation process to promptly inform the Management Risk and Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of any risk issues that could materially impact the Firm.\nERM manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure, which includes:\n[1] Dedicated \"vertical\" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;\n[2] \"Horizontal\" risk groups that monitor risks that cross all of State Street's business units, such as operational risk and credit risk, or that develop, maintain, and assess the effectiveness of the infrastructure that is used to support all of ERM's activities, such as Centralized Modeling and Analytics; and\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n15",

At its foundation is the Recovery and Resolution Planning function, responsible for developing and maintaining the firm-wide strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of State Street, the Centralized Modeling and Analytics function, which provides modeling and analytical support for ERM and Global Treasury, and Corporate Compliance, which establishes the firm-wide approach to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk globally.\nCorporate Compliance\nCorporate Compliance maintains State Street's Compliance Risk Management Policy, which establishes the firm-wide approach to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk globally. Compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation resulting from failure to comply with regulatory obligations.\nState Street has defined two categories of compliance risk: core compliance risk and embedded compliance risk. Corporate Compliance is responsible for overseeing the management of core compliance risk, which are those instances where the primary risk exposure is the failure to comply with regulatory obligations, through the administration of the Core Compliance Oversight Program (\"CCOP\"). Corporate Compliance is also responsible for ensuring policies to address the management of material core compliance risks are developed and communicated, as necessary. Embedded compliance risk, defined as instances where compliance with regulatory obligations is a component of another risk exposure but not the prevailing risk (e.g., credit risk, technology risk), is managed through specialized risk management programs administered by Enterprise Risk Management.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is responsible for overseeing the design, development and implementation of the CCOP globally. The Chief Compliance Officer meets regularly with the Examining & Audit Committee (\"E&A Committee\") to discuss the effectiveness of the CCOP and has the authority to communicate directly with the E&A Committee on any issues relevant to the CCOP. Annually, the Chief Compliance Officer liaises with the Senior Risk Officers responsible for overseeing areas of embedded compliance risk to compile and report an opinion of compliance risk management practices for each area of embedded compliance risk to the E&A Committee.\nState Street has a Standard of Conduct that describes the principles of business conduct expected of all employees of State Street and its subsidiaries globally.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 16",

AFW generates a notification to the requestor and the approver notifying them that a variance, if existing, needs to be addressed.

Evidence of this review is documented in the AFW package as the approver must add a comment to move the package to history status in AFW.\nTransaction Processing\nReceipt and Authentication of Transaction Instructions\nState Street business units receive trade instructions via Electronic Trade Delivery (\"ETD\") or manual delivery. State Street's FTTOP Policy requires that an originator's identity and transaction authority be verified upon receipt of trade instructions. Certain transaction delivery methods are considered secure and do not require additional authentication procedures (e.g., SWIFT, Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\") ID and Secure Transport). Procedures employed to authenticate transactions received via facsimile may include testkey, callback or signature verification.\nETD Trades\nElectronic trade files, including manual trade adjustments, trade cancellations and re-bookings and trade related journal entries, either in the pre-defined State Street or Industry Standard for Institutional Trade Communications (\"ISITC\") format, are delivered through SWIFT, DTCC ID or a user's own applications. Batch transmissions in the ISITC format go directly into the State Street mainframe common processing region (\"ETD Common\") (with the exception of ETF funds using ETF Global Platform) and the Fund ID contained in the trade instruction is systematically compared with the fund header record on MCH for authorization. Record counts and trade amounts are checked against batch trailer records for trades received as batch files. This verifies that the batch transmissions are complete and accurate.\nBatch transmissions not received in the proper industry standard format go through a translation prior to being transmitted to ETD Common. The translation process includes batch header and trailer checking which includes total trades, total shares and net amount for completeness and accuracy. When required by clients or if a header or trailer information is not provided, an acknowledgement message is sent to the client detailing the total number of trades processed.\nSWIFT\nETD Common may receive electronic trades via the SWIFT protocol. SWIFT messages are also monitored for completeness and incomplete files are sent to an exception queue for research and resolution.

Additional procedures are used to authenticate non-ETD instructions including callback, test key, signature validation or end-of-day reporting with the client or investment manager.\nOver-The-Counter (\"OTC\") Derivatives\nOTC derivatives represent a number of investment types including interest rate, credit default, currency, equity, total return swaps, swaptions and contracts for differences. Communication of trade notifications, payment and reset instructions for OTC derivatives are provided electronically or manually (facsimile, TLS, Secure Transport or non-ETD SWIFT).\nElectronic messages are typically sent to DHub, State Street's derivatives servicing platform, using Financial Products Markup Language (\"FpML\"), a messaging protocol for OTC derivatives. By using FpML, organizations can establish a set of detailed business and operational rules to automate the trade notification process and ensure that appropriate data is provided for update to accounting.\nCustody-Only Model\nState Street's Custody-Only model was designed to enable clients to process activity directly and straight through with little manual intervention by State Street. The Custody-Only model is based on State Street's core custody applications (SMAC/GSMAC). Clients of State Street's Custody-Only model go directly to assigned operational points of contact in Transaction Services or the Client Service team to resolve their issues.\nState Street also services custody-only clients using our MCH platform as the front end to our core custody applications. Controls for these clients are similar to our full-service clients and are described throughout this report as part of our core operations.\nFor certain clients of State Street's Custody-Only model, electronic trade files are delivered through SWIFT, a client's own system, or via a web-based application to ETD Common where the same completeness checks as described above are performed.\nState Street's FTTOP requires that an originator's identity and transaction authority be verified upon receipt of trade instructions. The FTTOP procedures applied to Custody-Only model clients are the same as for other State Street clients as described above.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 38",

A reconciliation report or checklist is utilized to determine whether all transactions received by ETD Common are processed in the accounting region. Transmissions that are not successfully loaded [ETD trades with errors) to the accounting region are reviewed, investigated and corrected within specified time frames through inquiry with the investment manager or client. Prior to the trades passing to MCH, a series of edit checks are performed in Global Transaction Manager (\"GTM\"), to determine whether the trade information is complete and can be automatically processed in MCH. Trades not passing the edit checks (e.g., settlement location and dates, valid asset ID, coupon rate, etc.) are systematically sent to a series of queues in GTM which are continuously monitored by either the Centralized Processing units or Global Delivery groups and researched and resolved before trades are released to the Electronic Trade Authorization (\"ETA\"). GTM utilizes ETA's concurrent posting functionality which is defined as the splitting of a single trade instruction into two separate trade instructions that are sent concurrently to the accounting and custody applications. An eligible trade must satisfy all edits in GTM before it is allowed to split and be sent to State Street's Custody Common Interface (\"CCI\"), to SMAC or GSMAC and to the ETD Accounting Region. Error-free ETD trades may be loaded directly to MCH or can be coded in the header file to be held for review.\nThe affirmation function may be performed by State Street, the investment manager, client or a third party. If the affirmation function is performed by the investment manager, client or a third party, trade information automatically processes to MCH. If State Street is responsible for trade affirmation, broker confirmations from non-ETD trades in the DTCC Interactive Institutional Delivery (\"IID\") application are compared in MCH or IIP to trade instructions received from the investment manager. ETD trades are electronically matched and the trade is processed to MCH. If transaction terms agree, an electronic affirmation message is sent back through BID to IID. Unaffirmed trades are researched and resolved with the client, investment manager and/or broker.\nAuthorized manual trade instructions are reviewed for completeness and accuracy and input into MCH via IIP or by individual Global Accounting groups or Centralized Processing unit personnel. International and certain domestic trades (based on pre-determined risk criteria such as dollar amount and settlement date) received via IIP are automatically routed to the authorization queue within IIP for review by a second individual. The reviewer authorizes the trade after comparing data input to the trade image on IIP. Upon authorization from the reviewer, and if the authentication process is complete, IIP automatically releases the transaction for downstream processing to MCH or the respective custody application. IIP will not release the item until both the authentication and authorization steps have been completed.\nMCH automatically checks trade instructions for completeness (required information includes fund, CUSIP, trade date, settlement date, security description, currency, settlement location, amount and shares) and performs certain online edit checks (e.g., calculates net amount and interest bought/sold). Trades manually input into MCH or respective custody applications are reviewed systematically or by a second individual.

GTM then performs additional edits (e.g., settlement location, valid asset ID, coupon rate, settlement date, etc.). Trades which do not pass the edit checks are reported in the client's queue for monitoring and research and resolution.\nRecording Transactions on DHub\nDHub supports a range of security types and transaction types for futures and options. Non-ETD futures and options transactions are manually input or systematically uploaded via pre-formatted files into DHub. The DHub Trade Hub Status User interface is used to monitor trade status (success, warning, error) for trades automatically or electronically processed to DHub.

Manual, off-line spreadsheets used to process derivatives are not in the scope of this report.\nRecording of Derivatives\nThe recording of certain over-the-counter derivatives, including swaps, swaptions and contract for differences are recorded and processed using DHub for locations as noted in Section III 6, Operations Overview and Section IV. Clients and their independent auditors should gain an understanding of the processes, controls and related servicing locations applicable to services provided by State Street for OTC derivatives recorded on DHub.\nDHub is used in two models. The trade post model places DHub \"in front\" of MCH. This allows DHub to capture OTC trade activity and utilizes its functionality to calculate the cash flows and accruals on the OTC trades. This information is then used to verify and update downstream applications such as MCH ensuring the accuracy of client information. All other downstream reporting remains the same as it was prior to the use of DHub.\nThe General Ledger (\"G/L\") Post Model utilizes DHub as a sub-ledger to the MCH accounting platform. Position, cash and trade information from DHub and MCH is passed downstream into a data warehouse where client reporting applications can access the data to complete their respective deliverables.\nError-free electronic OTC derivative trades are automatically received in DHub or loaded manually to DHub before release to MCH. DHub queues are monitored throughout the day to verify that transactions pass edit checks and are posting to accounting timely and accurately. Trades with a \"warning\" or \"error\" status are researched and resolved within established deadlines. For funds using DHub G/L Post functionality, the only reflection of swap data on MCH is through the posting of general ledger entries.\nAuthenticated manual transactions received via facsimile are reviewed for completeness and manually input to DHub or MCH. Completeness of transaction receipt is monitored via callbacks, transmission status, confirmation sheets or end-of-day recap reporting with the investment manager or client. Manual transactions are subject to review by a second individual against the original trade directive.

Loan Services provides accounting and recordkeeping support for institutional loans held across all product structures, including U.S. mutual funds, partnership products, structured products, non-U.S. and institutional funds. The WSO application and MCH are used to perform institutional loan tracking and accounting as well as provide general ledger accounting and reporting. WSO provides multiple-level accrual functionality on individual credits, commitment level accounting and loan valuation functionality via quotes provided by vendors and stores reference information for institutional loans.\nLoan Services receives manual and electronic trade information from clients or investment managers and other loan market information (e.g., agent notices, prices) directly from market participants. Authorized institutional loan trades received from clients or investment managers are recorded in WSO daily and reviewed by Loan Services supervisory personnel. If a trade summary is received from the client or investment manager it is reconciled to trade activity posted to WSO to verify completeness. For loan positions recorded and maintained in MCH, trade activity from WSO is either automatically or manually updated in MCH by Loan Services. The manually input trade activity is reviewed by a second individual for accuracy and completeness of the posting.\nFor loan positions recorded and maintained in MCH, amortization/accretion and unrealized and realized gains/ losses are calculated via core MCH processing, including the respective loan information.

Global Accounting groups can research investment details directly from the masterfile database through input of an asset or relevant market ID number on MCH.\nReference Data\nThe Alveo application provides centralized data management solutions for reference data. There are three parts to the Alveo solution: Acquisition Management (\"AQM\") is an application that acquires vendor data; Alveo is an application that processes and stores the data; and Distribution, Metering and Entitlements (\"DME\") is an application that formats and distributes data to the RSM on the State Street mainframe.\nAQM is used to schedule, retrieve and monitor vendor feeds based on an established schedule and then sends them to Alveo. AQM then monitors the feed processing progress to the basic (raw vendor) level in Alveo. Vendor feeds that do not meet established processing criteria (i.e., are not received at their scheduled time or take longer than the expected processing time) are reported to Reference Services via the AQM Graphical User Interface (\"GUI\") and all activity is captured for reporting. Reference Services personnel will then take appropriate research and remediation actions based on the specific facts and circumstances. Activity performed by Reference Services personnel is captured in an audit view in the application for reporting purposes and all activity is reviewed and requires a comment to be input to track resolution.\nAQM sends the vendor data to Alveo, including data from Bloomberg, Refinitiv, DTCC and Canadian Depository Services.

The details received in the messages are systematically validated and sent to Alveo for new security creation following established rules within the Alveo platform. AQM systematically provides success/response messages back to the requesting application with newly created State Street Asset ID or details of rejection reason. Each security request received in AQM is viewable in the AQM dashboard with current status of the request. The AQM dashboard is monitored by Reference Services personnel for resolution of any requests that do not pass Alveo's systematic validations and require manual resolution to complete the creation of the security record.\nDME distributes the completed records from Alveo to the RSM. If an Alveo record has been marked for review, it will not be distributed until the review is complete and has gone through the approval \"audit\" review described above. DME monitors the successful distribution and processing by RSM and displays processing errors in the DME GUI for research and remediation based on the specific facts and circumstances.

Upon receipt of a request, Reference Services personnel research the security using outside, independent sources. Security details such as CUSIP, rate, maturity date, issuer name, issuer description, issue date, interest payment dates, basis and frequency are reviewed. Independent sources most often used include Intercontinental Exchange (\"ICE\"), SIX Financial Information, Bloomberg, Refinitiv, S&P and Euroclear. If the CUSIP or SEDOL number given is invalid, personnel attempt to research the security by other criteria and/or contact the requestor to receive a valid identifier. After the security is reviewed using outside sources and changes are approved, the data is entered into Alveo. The Quality Control team performs quality review checks for new additions which have an associated market identifier (e.g., CUSIP, ISIN, SEDOL, etc.). Once security data is entered, MCH automatically cross references to review that the security has not previously been set up. If no duplication is identified, the security is automatically added. If the security is already set up, personnel will reject the addition request and inform the requestor. Supervisory personnel regularly monitor unprocessed request queues.\nAdditionally, Alveo receives Bloomberg intraday feeds that are reviewed by Reference Services personnel in order to cleanse and consolidate security reference data into a gold copy.

If Reuters confirms the security data, an asset identifier is assigned and MCH automatically cross references to review that the security has not already been set up using key data fields. An addition can only be added to MCH without a vendor identifier as OTC (over the counter). Once the cross reference is complete, the derivative is added to MCH. If there are significant discrepancies between the request and Reuters, the request is rejected back to the requestor for additional information.\nSecurity Factors and Rate Resets\nGovernment Paydown Factors\nState Street receives monthly data transmissions from SIAC for GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC pooled assets and daily transmissions from ICE for CMOs, IOs and other asset-backed securities. These data transmissions are received into the reference database from outside vendors and are automatically updated to MCH. File transmission is monitored for completeness through record counts. MCH performs automatic tolerance checks prior to the data upload to the Government Factor Database. To review the accuracy of the daily data transmissions received from ICE, items that change greater than the predetermined tolerance level in MCH will be printed on an exception report. Reference Services personnel agree these factors to an outside source (e.g., Bloomberg) and manually update MCH as appropriate. Discrepancies are resolved through discussions with ICE and Bloomberg personnel.\nRate Resets for Variable Rate Demand Notes\nMunicipal Market Data (\"MMD\") updates rate resets for VRDNs twice a day by transmitting Variable Rate Feeds to State Street. Variable Rate Feeds are monitored for completeness and accuracy through record counts and date checks. After the transmission has been received and checked for completeness, a Reference Services administrator reviews the reports online to identify errors and views a summary of total rate changes for tolerance checks. The review on these reports is to gauge the accuracy of the transmission and to monitor the percentage of total rates loaded and updated. The fund groups are then informed of the availability of the rates via a daily notification accessed through MCH. Rate resets and factors are automatically applied to client holdings.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n46",

The Client Services or Client Support personnel will complete the internal applicable collateral documents (e.g., Information Needed for Escrow Receipts, Index Option Escrow Deposit/Withdrawal Request form and Collateral Ticket Asset Segregation form, etc.) depending on the nature of the transaction and/or agreements in place with State Street. The Collateral Services team receives the required collateral documents from the investment manager or Global Delivery, Client Services or Client Support personnel for processing.\nAuthorized instructions are received from clients and asset managers via facsimile, SWIFT, Secure Transport or TLS Secure email for which State Street acts as the directed custodian by processing as directed through the authorized instructions. The Collateral Services team processes these instructions to State Street's custody applications (SMAC/GSMAC) for the global client base.\nUpon receipt, the Collateral Services team will review documentation for completeness and proper authorization. If incomplete, the Collateral Services team follows up with the contact person or Client Services team for external directives for corrections. The Collateral Services team does not alter the instructions in any way. Incomplete instructions are rejected. Collateral Services team personnel process complete and accurate instructions for securities as collateral to the respective category on SMAC/GSMAC and cash as collateral on Hogan/IBS depending on the nature of the request. The Collateral Services team reviews all processing of securities on SMAC/GSMAC and cash on Hogan/IBS for completeness and accuracy to the corresponding instructions. Once review is complete, the collateral is authorized to be released within SMAC/GSMAC and Hogan.\nClient Services or Client Support personnel monitor segregated securities for possible redemptions, maturities and expiration. To release a security for a closed/expired option contract, Client Services or Client Support personnel must obtain approval from the client and/or broker and complete the applicable form requesting release of the collateral. The form is signed by an authorized individual and forwarded to the Collateral Services team for processing on SMAC/GSMAC.\nFor cash escrow receipts issued at the OCC, in the event of a fund liquidating its option position before exercise date, collateral is not released until the broker approves the early withdrawal posted at the OCC. The OCC has updated their process so that security collateral used for escrow receipts is directly released by the broker at DTC.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 47",

Client Services or Client Support personnel must obtain the client's authorized signature and complete all applicable internal collateral forms, and forward them to the Collateral Services team for processing on SMAC.\nThe broker and OCC are notified of the collateral value via the OCC's \"Encore\" internet application. The deposit notification confirms to the broker and the OCC that State Street has segregated sufficient collateral to cover the value of the option contract. Collateral shares are pledged at DTC, and the pledge data flows automatically into the OCC's \"Encore\" internet application, confirming sufficiency of collateral. For cash collateral, an online printout from the OCC approving the transaction is received and filed.\nIn order to determine compliance with OCC regulations, the Collateral Services team monitors the market value of the collateral held. The identified collateral is input in the CMW/Colline database that produces a daily escrow receipt report. CMW/Colline calculates the market value of collateral held at the close of each day. The OCC requires that the initial deposit of collateral be equal to or exceed 100% of the value of the outstanding contract. If the value of the collateral falls below 85% of the value of the outstanding option contract, a warning message will be generated from CMW/Colline and the Collateral Services team notifies the Client Services or Client Support groups to identify additional collateral.\nGermany\nIn Germany, for the fund business, pledge agreements are based on contracts among clients, clearing banks and State Street Bank International GmbH. They require as collateral either securities to be pledged or cash to be transferred in accordance with stock exchange regulations in order to satisfy initial margin requirements. The securities are segregated by State Street Bank International GmbH on behalf of the clearing banks which cover (and are reimbursed for) initial margin requirements, if the initial margin is not paid in cash. Daily variation margins are payments made in cash on behalf of State Street Bank International GmbH's clients and their counterparties. Cash is transferred to clearing banks.\nInitial margin requirements are reviewed by State Street Bank International GmbH daily. If the value of pledged securities falls below initial margin requirements, the clearing bank informs State Street Bank International GmbH and the client who is obligated to identify additional securities to be segregated in order to satisfy the requirements of the stock exchange.\nCollateral Held Externally\nFor certain portfolios, collateral for derivative transactions is delivered to and held by the broker or other authorized third parties. The Collateral Services team or Global Delivery personnel record the collateral activity (delivery and returns) at the time of the delivery/return. In addition, Global Delivery personnel may deliver collateral to external brokers or banks for other instruments and/or transactions requiring hard segregated collateral.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n48",

Discrepancies, if any, are researched and resolved by AOPM/Limited Partnerships personnel.\nPeriodically (i.e., daily or monthly), the AOPM/Limited Partnerships Team performs a cash adjusted market value (\"CAMV\") calculation within eCFM to systematically mark-to-market the investments in MCH. Using the current General Partner capital balances, eCFM will perform an automated CAMV calculation by adjusting for cash flows that occurred from the last period ending date through the specified ending date. After the calculation is completed and MCH has been updated, LP Services personnel complete an ending CAMV reconciliation to verify that calculated eCFM ending market values agree to the MCH investment holdings. Differences are investigated and resolved. Additionally, an unrealized period-over-period check is performed to verify the change in MCH unrealized balance is attributed to a General Partner cash flow or new statement update. Differences are investigated and resolved.\nSettlement\nU.S. Settlement\nState Street is a direct participant in two major U.S. depositories: The DTCC and the Federal Reserve Book Entry System. With respect to physical securities, State Street uses DTCC and their Custody program in New Jersey (formerly located in New York) as depository for the majority of physical securities. Actual processing of critical settlement and income-related activity is performed in a split operations environment by securities operations units in the U.S., Canada and India.\nDepository Trust and Clearing Corporation\nState Street maintains an electronic interface with DTCC to send and receive current business day data from State Street's custody application (SMAC) to DTCC. The direct link with OMGEO's Trade Suite ID application, a third-party vendor application, enables State Street to receive and transmit trade ID confirm/affirm messages via multiple transmissions throughout the day. Trade instructions for DTCC are updated to SMAC via electronic feeds from accounting platforms or other trade-entry vehicles, although some are manually input directly into SMAC. Trade instructions are subject to SMAC point-to-point authorization controls and other edits, as necessary.\nOn settlement date minus one, a batch file of ID affirmed sells are compared and matched to client pending trade instructions. The matched sell ID affirmations are sent to DTCC via Network Data Mover (\"NDM\"). Non-affirmed client sale instructions are sent to DTCC electronically on settlement date minus one or settlement date (depending on the timing of trade instruction). A position check at the client/CUSIP level is performed on sells prior to release to DTCC. Only sells with sufficient positions are released. Sells with insufficient positions recycle on the SMAC custody platform until sufficient positions are available.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION I\n51",

Acknowledgement messages update SMAC pending trade records to a settled status if certain key data fields match or are within certain thresholds. Sell transactions for which the counterparty does not agree with the terms (e.g., reclaim trades) are either cancelled or returned by the counterparty creating an electronic acknowledgement message that automatically places the sell to a failed status on SMAC. Unmatched acknowledgement messages and returned deliveries are researched by administrators and resolved prior to end-of-day. Upon receipt of instructions, DTCC adjusts via book entry, share balances of State Street's omnibus account.\nEnd-of-day summary and settlement reports generated from DTCC and SMAC are compared and verified. SMAC share and cash settlement totals are reconciled to depository totals. The final DTCC settlement dollar values are totaled for State Street participant accounts. The net State Street cash position is matched to the DTCC position report and the appropriate funds are sent to/from DTCC to satisfy the settlement obligation. A SMAC cash payments file is created to update the individual client accounts on the Hogan (DDA) application, and an end-of-day batch file updates settlement status in MCH.\nFederal Reserve\nState Street interfaces with the Federal Reserve through a real-time link utilizing the Securities Transfer System (\"STS\"). STS is a Tandem nonstop application that provides position control and custody recordkeeping for U.S. Government and Agency securities held in State Street's book entry accounts at the Fed in Boston. It is also a computer-to-computer communications link to the Fed's National Book-Entry System (\"NBES\"), for automated transmission and receipt of security transfer instructions.\nMost trade instructions are updated to STS via electronic feeds from accounting platforms or other trade entry vehicles, although some are manually input directly on STS. Trade instructions are subject to applicable STS edits and controls. Once updated on STS, the trade instructions flow directly and simultaneously to SMAC and NBES (deliveries only). Upon receipt of instructions, the Fed debits or credits State Street's reserve account and adjusts, via book-entry, share balances of State Street's omnibus account. An acknowledgement message is then sent back to State Street through NBES to STS. STS updates and settles the trade on SMAC and the individual client accounts on the Hogan (DDA] application.\nSTS automatically updates returned sale trades from the Fed to a \"failed\" status (returned trades are those for which the participating broker does not have matching instructions and, therefore, the Fed has reversed settlement). When possible, returned sales are communicated to the originating department. Based on the originating department's response, the returned sales are reprocessed on a best-effort basis prior to the Fed's daily close.\nAdministrators identify unmatched wires from STS and work with the appropriate business unit to resolve any exceptions.

Sell fails are reported to management daily.\nNon-U.S. Settlement\nThe subcustodian bank, hired by State Street, performs custodial functions for State Street clients in the market in which it has expertise. The role of the subcustodian includes trade pre-matching, settling and vaulting securities, collecting income, sending information to State Street regarding cash and security movements, cash balances, security positions, notification of corporate actions and upcoming income events and reporting changes in the market environment and tax regulations.\nThe Global Custody Communications Unit is responsible for the processing of international trade instructions received from originating departments and for monitoring incoming and outgoing communications with subcustodians.\nAuthorized non-U.S. trade instructions are automatically transmitted from GTM to GSMAC. GSMAC performs a series of online edit checks (e.g., completeness of instructions). If the instructions pass all the edit checks, GSMAC will forward the trade to the subcustodians and non-U.S. depositories (CREST, Euroclear and Clearstream) via SWIFT or self-custody units via SWIFT or LCCS. GSMAC edit exceptions are resolved by the Global Custody Communications Unit and Global Custody Settlements and self-custody teams.

        "content": "GLOBAL FUND ACCOUNTING AND CUSTODY\nCertain contractual settlement results in credit exposure to State Street as a result of advancing funds to clients. Client eligibility is determined by credit risk rating thresholds established by ERM and quality ratings of documentary risk (i.e., the quality of the client's contract language). Clients that meet or exceed the established risk thresholds are eligible to participate in the standard contractual settlement service. Clients that do not meet the established credit risk and/or quality ratings may still be eligible for contractual settlement services but would need to obtain exception authorization from the appropriate risk and/or legal party. Once a client has been approved, a request is forwarded to the Global Support Services (\"GSS\") Help Desk to set up the appropriate client portfolio header records, establishing the fund for contractual settlement eligibility.\nRisk Monitoring monitors exposure levels daily for all contractually eligible clients to determine whether the funding of the sell fails are within established credit limits. Risk Monitoring also calculates credit limits within policy guidelines monthly based on current client Net Asset Value information. The majority of the credit limit guidelines are derived via automated calculations from the Intraday Exposure Monitoring application. Any exception for clients that require a limit greater than policy limit must be reviewed and approved by ERM.\nContractually eligible U.S. buy and sell transactions are identified by Risk Monitoring in the U.S. via SMAC/ GSMAC and the cash portion of the security transaction is funded to the client's DDA account and applicable general ledger accounts on the contractual settlement date. For buy fails, the client's DDA is debited and a separate buy fail processing general ledger account is credited. For sell fails, the client's fund DDA is credited and the applicable State Street general ledger account is debited. The State Street buy and sell fail accounts are reconciled daily by Global Custody personnel and reviewed by Global Custody management.\nFailed Trades\nFailed trades are monitored daily through online reviews of SMAC/GSMAC and STS or certain areas also use reporting tools that systematically extract failed settlement information directly from SMAC/GSMAC. Failed trades are researched by Global Custody Settlements or U.S. Securities Operations on SMAC/GSMAC as applicable. If necessary, corrective action is taken based on authorized instruction from the investment manager or client.\nSafekeeping of Assets\nEnterprise Reconciliation in Global Delivery is responsible for cash and security position reconcilements with central depositories (reference to central depositories includes CDS in Canada, CBF in Germany, CREST in the U.K. and DTCC in the U.S.) and subcustodians through automated reconcilement programs, ensuring account statements are received from subcustodians at least monthly.

Tax reclaim receivables are processed by utilizing the Tax Reclaim System (\"TRS\"), an application designed to automatically process and track reclaims on taxes withheld by foreign tax authorities. Reclaim filings are completed based on local market filing requirements and tracked by Subcustodian Tax Reclaims until paid by the local tax authority.\nTax Documentation supports the documentation and certification process as required to effect proper withholding, exemption, relief at source and reclaim opportunities in many markets. Local jurisdiction documentation required to facilitate reduction at source, exemption and tax reclaims is also requested on behalf of clients, solicited from clients, tracked and maintained.\nDepository Processing supports the reduction at source and reclaim filing process as required to effect proper withholding, exemption and reclaim opportunities through Clearstream, DTCC and Euroclear. The Depository Processing Unit also utilizes TRS to process and track reclaims.\nTax Research is responsible for researching tax entitlements on investment income by reviewing double taxation, treaties and domestic law as they pertain to taxation, client account structure as it impacts taxation, market practices and procedures required to support and direct tax table maintenance and capital gains taxation.\nThe Accounting Research group is responsible for identifying the U.S. taxability of complex Canadian, Swedish, U.K. and U.S. corporate actions and providing line areas with MCH accounting instructions reflecting the taxability of the actions.\nThe U.S. Non Resident Alien (\"NRA\") Tax Unit performs the daily withholding of U.S. tax from the Non-U.S. Resident clients who invest in U.S. instruments and the remittance of those taxes to the IRS. The U.S. NRA Tax Unit also supports on a limited basis certain other U.S. domestic tax reporting, prepares annual tax reporting to both clients and the IRS and tax filing on behalf of the nominees to the IRS.\nThe Canadian Withholding Tax team performs withholding of Canadian income tax from non-resident investors and submits these withholding taxes to the Canadian Revenue Agency (\"CRA\"). They also support annual Canadian reporting to clients and the CRA.\nThe Client Service team is responsible for supporting client presentations, Request for Proposal (\"RFPs\"] and servicing agreements.

        "content": "GLOBAL FUND ACCOUNTING AND CUSTODY\nTax Entitlement Processing\nThe Tax Research team tracks Treaty and Domestic Law tax rate changes. Withholding tax and reclaim rate changes are checked to independent sources and reviewed by management for accuracy. Upon completion of the management review, a request is sent to the appropriate business unit to update Global Tax Tables (\"GTT\") with the change. MCH automatically calculates withholding taxes timely and establishes accruals for income and tax reclaim receivables.\nThe tax reclaim coordinator monitors accrued tax receivables and prepares and files required documentation with the subcustodian or the country's tax authority. Market practice and, in some cases, residency dictate filing frequency and follow-up confirmation steps. Reclaims are monitored by Custody Tax Services via a weekly status summary report. Follow-up steps are taken as needed to confirm filing status prior to the expiration of the statute and limitations and again to ensure timely payment receipt. Payment information is processed automatically or manually by the Custody Tax Services Payment Team, which updates TRS and the receivable on MCH to a PAID status.\nReduction at Source and Exemptions\nReduction at source or up-front filing refers to those circumstances whereby clients may be paid income net of tax withholding and reclaim amounts. Depending on the market, documentation may need to be filed annually or based on each income event in order to effect these opportunities. Exemptions generally allow an eligible investor to receive income gross. Subcustodian account openings are monitored for applicable markets to request documentation from business areas for execution and proper filing.\nTax Reclaims\nTax reclaim receivables are generated on TRS and MCH at the time of the income event based on rates contained within the GTT. The Global Tax Tables provide a hierarchy supporting specific asset, client exemption, investment type and generic withholding tax rates.\nSubcustodian Tax Reclaims\nTRS is an end-to-end workflow application that supports the tax reclaim processes. The TRS platform integrates client and market information with custody data to create and track receivables. TRS tracks receivables through their entire life span from creation to payment using descriptive status codes. Documentation requirements are tracked by TRS and reclaim forms are generated by the application on behalf of the individual beneficiary for each reclaim market. The forms are forwarded to the appropriate party for signature and certification nor signed under an applicable Power of Attorney (\"POA\"). Tax reclaims are filed on an ongoing basis or batched according to market practice and filed with the subcustodians or directly with the tax authority. Market practice and, in some cases, residency dictate filing frequency and follow-up confirmation steps. Cash payment information is received directly by GIC via SWIFT messages from the subcustodians and is posted to client accounts automatically or manually by the Tax Payment Team on IBS and MCH. The payment is processed on TRS and the receivable is moved to a PAID status.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 67",

The Euroclear Euclid terminal is monitored for announcements of future payable dates in the Euroclear Depository. Client eligibility is determined based on residency using the ADR module within TRS. For clients who are not eligible for reduction at source, a reclaim is generated which flows through the normal TRS workflow process. The required forms are generated based on market procedures and client entitlement. After review, the documents are forwarded to either the U.S. sponsoring agent or the local subcustodian.\nAustralia\nTaxation information is regularly reviewed by State Street's tax specialists prior to the taxation reports being provided to clients.\nThe taxation reporting process requires a reconciliation to the accounting information. Material reconciling differences between the accounting application information and taxation reports are identified and reviewed regularly.

The income repatriation application will systematically aggregate amounts and request foreign exchange amounts from the subcustodians via SWIFT messages. On settlement date, the subcustodian's SWIFT settlement messages are matched to the pending file and ICASH and Hogan are updated.\nGlobal Corporate Action Processing\nCorporate Actions Operations, a department in Global Delivery, is responsible for processing U.S. and non- U.S. corporate actions. Corporate Actions Operation's responsibilities include identification and distribution of corporate action data to clients, the communication of elections on voluntary events to the market and processing and settlement of corporate actions such as stock dividends on SMAC/GSMAC which is reviewed by Corporate Actions Operations and by centralized processing units. Past-due cash and share exception reports of corporate actions are reviewed by Corporate Actions Operations and aged items are researched and resolved with the paying agent. Core Operating teams reside in Canada, the U.K., the U.S. and India.\nCorporate Action Identification and Notification\nBoth U.S. and non-U.S. corporate action events are identified via automatic and manual sources, including vendor transmissions, depositories, subcustodians and nominee/direct mail and periodical review. Vendor feeds are electronically fed into the Global Corporate Action System (\"GCAS\") which also feeds the Corporate Action Monitoring System (\"CAMS\"). Vendor feeds with missing or conflicting information are researched and resolved by Corporate Actions Operations personnel. Corporate action feeds are monitored for completeness through record counts and data checks. Non-automated source information is input manually to GCAS and reviewed by a second individual, and when possible verified to a second source. Data entered into GCAS is subject to various format, missing field, validation, limit and check digit controls. Non-U.S. corporate actions are identified by the subcustodians (including the self-custody units), market depositories and vendors. Corporate action information and dividends are received from vendors via leased lines or encrypted over the internet. Corporate action information received from subcustodians is received via SWIFT. Where State Street is reflecting a holder of the applicable security on MCH or SMAC/GSMAC, GCAS retrieves entitled share positions for identified corporate actions automatically from SMAC/GSMAC.\nInformation necessary for corporate action notification is input to GCAS, reviewed by a second individual, if applicable, through reference to source documentation and assigned pending status. Full notifications are generated by GCAS prior to ex-date (expiration date) and sent to Centralized Processing units or investment managers via SWIFT or CAPTAIN. Notification delivery is monitored by IT and any non-delivery items are immediately addressed. If the share position (as detailed on SMAC/GSMAC) is modified prior to ex-date/ expiration date, GCAS' share tracking functionality will automatically identify position changes and generate a re-notification to centralized processing units or the investment manager.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION II\n69",

Manually adjusted subscriptions and redemptions which were loaded into the ETF Global Platform are subject to review for accuracy and completeness against the original data from the Transfer Agent and evidence of review is maintained on the daily checklist.\nVoluntary Corporate Action Response Processing\nVoluntary Corporate Action Response processing is performed in the U.S. Responses may be delivered electronically via CAPTAIN, SWIFT or facsimile. Responses received via SWIFT and passing certain IT validity, accuracy and completeness checks will be processed automatically. SWIFT responses that cannot be processed automatically, or responses received via facsimile, are reviewed for both validity and accuracy, by a second individual prior to being updated in GCAS.

Clients are requested to sign a written FTTOP agreement with State Street specifying the type of security procedures to be used for transfers of funds where there is no immediate exchange of value. Cash disbursements are authenticated for appropriate client authorization in accordance with the client's signed FTTOP agreement or alternative security procedures agreed to by the business unit and client. If a client does not agree to accept the standard FTTOP security procedures or declines to sign the agreement, an approved Client or Business Unit Exception may be submitted. Cash disbursements are automatically (via Expense Manager or eCFM functionality) or manually recorded on VMW, MCH (via CCTX functionality), Hogan (via OMP functionality) and IIP directly. Manually input transactions are reviewed to supporting documentation by a second individual for accuracy and timeliness.\nFor funds utilizing Expense Manager, an individual in Global Accounting selects the allocation methodology (e.g., average net assets, straight line, percentage by fund or fixed amount by fund) in Expense Manager based on client instructions. Expense Manager automatically calculates the amount of the vendor invoice to be allocated based on the selected methodology. The invoice is approved within Expense Manager by authorized personnel and Expense Manager posts the payment to MCH and to Hogan. Expense Manager does not release the payment to post to MCH and Hogan until approved.\nFor funds using eCFM, authorized individuals input the payment amount using pre-established templates that identify the payment type, payee and the appropriate accounting treatment based on rules identified in the initial set-up of the template. The payment is approved within eCFM by a second authorized individual and eCFM posts the payment to MCH and Hogan.

Alternatively, amortization/accretion may be calculated off-line by Global Accounting personnel (off-line calculations are not included within the scope of this report). Income change alerts are generated within eHorizon to notify the Global Accounting groups of any missing data needed to calculate the amortization/accretion. The Global Accounting groups must clear alerts in order for eHorizon to process the amortization/accretion and post to MCH. On settlement date, for new security acquisitions, Global Accounting personnel confirm that necessary parameters are set up accurately for amortization/accretion and reviews posting amounts for reasonability.\nThe amortization/accretion methodology provided by the client is often based on the tax guidelines and differs from the methodology prescribed by local accounting standards. In order to provide these clients with information that will allow them to present associated amounts in their financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting standards, State Street built functionality into MCH to generate the AICPA Mandatory Amortization Review Reports (the \"Reports\"). The Reports compute the amortized cost for each security using the \"effective interest method,\" compare that cost against the cost on MCH and produce an \"intra- period\" adjustment. For certain securities noted in the Reports by a flag and/or message indicator, the Global Accounting groups or client manually calculates the amortization and accretion adjustments. The Global Accounting personnel and supervisory personnel review both the automatically and manually calculated adjustments for completeness and accuracy. MCH also allows multiple base amortization calculations for multi-basis structures. See discussion under the \"Multi-Basis\" heading.\nThe Reports are only appropriate for investment companies using the identified cost methodology. For investment companies using the average cost methodology, bond premium amortization and discount accretion adjustments are calculated manually by Global Accounting personnel. Both the Global Accounting personnel and supervisory personnel review the manually calculated amortization adjustments for completeness and accuracy.\nMulti-Basis\nMulti-Basis, a functionality in MCH, allows multiple base calculations/structures (e.g., U.S. GAAP, U.S. Tax, AICPA, IFRS) for any fund or portfolio. Multi-basis allows specific calculations and rules (par rules, amortization rules, transaction costs, valuation, corporate actions rules, etc.) to post related transactions to multiple accounting basis within MCH. The anchor basis is the primary basis and the comparison or second basis is the alternative basis. Multi-Basis accounting processes calculations or compiles data by utilizing either a default or customizable rule structure depending on which basis is being utilized (e.g., AICPA or IFRS).\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n75",

Some Real-Time alerts halt updates from the anchor fund to the second basis until cleared.\nIn the U.S., Global Accounting personnel review Real-Time and Reporting Alerts and take the appropriate action to clear the alerts prior to the books being closed at each financial reporting period. Multi-Basis maintains a history of the in-progress and cleared alerts, including date and time the alert was cleared, how the alert was cleared and who cleared the alert.\nIn Australia and Canada, reports are generated and/or reconciliations are prepared and Multi-Basis reports are generated at each reporting period to identify discrepancies between the anchor and second basis. Discrepancies above the defined tolerance limits are researched and resolved. For clients electing to amortize for IFRS reporting, MCH automatically calculates amortization/accretion using the IFRS effective interest method.\nMulti-Basis maintains a core set of reports which includes, but is not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 Trial Balance Comparison\n\u00b7 Holdings report\n\u00b7 Purchases report\n\u00b7 Sales report\n\u00b7 Amortization Income Comparison report\n.

Application controls such as automated tolerance checks and transmission edit checks are performed and the receipt of each file is reviewed for completeness.\nFor some securities, paydown factors must be processed manually to MCH. Manually processed paydown factors are obtained from other vendor sources or the client/investment manager. A record of securities processed manually is maintained.\nPayments received through SMAC/GSMAC are automatically applied to the clients' accounts on Hogan, SMAC/GSMAC and MCH (if in agreement).

Claims are submitted to the paying agent for payments not received.\nExpense Accruals\nExpenses are accrued based on budgeted expense amounts in accordance with client or other authorized party instructions. Funds are disbursed when bills are received and authorization is obtained. Fixed expenses are generally determined based on the annual fee divided by business days in the calendar year and remain constant unless written authorization from the client is received. Variable expenses change based on certain expense drivers (e.g., asset management fees vary based on changes in average net assets) and may be modified to reflect changes in the key drivers. The variable expense rate is provided by the client or other authorized party. Expense accruals are calculated and recorded to the fund's general ledger daily, either automatically in MCH directly, via Expense Manager functionality or via off-line spreadsheet by Global Accounting groups based on established accrual rates.

The individual security positions in a pool are owned by the sub-funds participating in the pool proportionate to their ownership ratios. State Street's pooling platform is fully integrated into the proprietary custody and accounting platform and provides a robust and scalable solution for complex intra- and extra-fund pooling structures. The pooling process is fully controlled through one centralized processing control screen called PLCP, which is the MCH function code assigned to the Pooling Control Cycle/Process.\nAll pooling controls take place within the PLCP functionality which is embedded in core MCH technology. The process is opened when contributions and/or withdrawals are allocated from the pool's participant fund(s) to the pool. Upon creation of contribution/withdrawal records for the current day, Global Accounting personnel run the request to update the ownership ratios. If there have been no transactions for the day, a zero contribution record is posted. The fund group performs a reconciliation to validate the system- generated ownership ratios and differences are researched and resolved. Based on the new ownership ratios, rebalancing activity is automatically generated and posted at the participating funds' level. MCH replicates new pool activity and automatically posts it at the participating funds' level. Trades that have not been released are identified via an electronic trade processing queue and manually released by Global Accounting personnel. Once the pooling cycle has been completed, the participating fund's NAV calculation is completed using State Street's standard systems, controls and procedures.\nSecurity Valuation\nGlobal Pricing Services\nGlobal Pricing Services (\"GPS\") is a team within Securities Valuation Shared Services that is responsible for the collection, validation, enrichment and distribution of pricing-related data for State Street's global client base. GPS supports the pricing needs for clients requiring daily pricing on the EPW application and clients requiring less time-critical, non-daily valuations on MCH.\nPricing-related data is systematically obtained from third-party vendors as the markets close around the globe or at specific intra-day valuation points for European clients. Pricing administration and data center personnel work in tandem to monitor these transmissions for timeliness to ensure files are received and processed in time to meet client deliverables. Once the files are received into State Street, via real-time or batch data feeds, the security price data is automatically populated in the pricing database, NAVigator, where they are available for data content review by GPS personnel.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 78",

EPW systematically identifies pricing exceptions (including derivatives security prices). EPW systematically requires all exceptions to be cleared prior to the prices being delivered to the applicable receiving systems. Upon completion of the batch job, updated prices on MCH are available to internal and external users. Once the vendor prices are loaded to the pricing database, they undergo a rigorous screening process by GPS personnel. Daily, the following checks are performed at the file/vendor source level:\nGPS personnel perform a second source verification of equity prices. This verification is performed where there are two prices available from the primary and the secondary vendors. There is a 0% tolerance for this comparison on closed markets and a 1% for intraday snaps. Any exceptions on the closed markets are researched, typically to Bloomberg, and resolved prior to dissemination throughout State Street applications such as MCH and EPW. Intraday reports are reviewed to identify significant issues with the vendor snapped data. In addition to the second source verification of equity prices, GPS also performs a day-over-day tolerance of these prices. Price movements breaking a predetermined threshold, versus a relevant local index, are researched for news and other relevant information to substantiate the price movement. The results of this research are stored centrally on the GPS intranet website for all global business areas to review.\nFixed income security prices undergo a security level price audit. Current day prices are compared to the previous day at a predetermined threshold to identify securities that fall outside the tolerance level. Security prices that do not pass the tolerance checks are returned to the original vendor in the form of a price challenge.\nIn addition to the collection, validation, enrichment and distribution of pricing-related data, GPS also supports the administration functions on the EPW application. GPS personnel set up new funds and process changes (including fair value) to existing funds in EPW upon receipt of the appropriate EPW Fund Add form from authorized personnel. All completed fund set-ups or changes to EPW are reviewed by a second individual in GPS by comparing the information posted to EPW against the EPW Fund Add form. Exceptions are followed up on and resolved.\nExchange Rates\nCurrency exchange rates (used for translation) are obtained at specific hourly intervals by GPS throughout the day for State Street's global client base from a third-party vendor.\nOTC Derivatives\nThe review of pricing vendor feeds in DHub is performed in Canada, China (Hangzhou), Poland and the U.S. (Sacramento) for the global client base.

Fair Value pricing may be required based on predetermined market triggers/indicators or specific market events as instructed by the clients. The fair value process is executed after the closing price is established but before the fund NAV is calculated.\nUpon receipt of the EPW Fund Add Form, GPS sets the fund up for fair value pricing (e.g., vendor, trigger, exchanges and confidence level/significant measure, as applicable) within EPW after verifying that the set-up is approved by an authorized State Street employee. EPW automates the ability to invoke systematic fair value pricing based on available market triggers such as S&P 500\u00ae, Russell 1000\u00ae and Russell 2000\u00ae or on a daily basis as specified in the EPW Fund Add Form.\nUpon client request or in accordance with the client's standing instruction, State Street utilizes the EPW application and receives fair value factors from third-party vendors, to apply fair value factors to closing prices from the local exchanges.

Tasks and workflows within DNAV are conducted through straight-through processing with users' time being used to analyze data and validate exceptions through automated alerts.\nDNAV Onboarding\nPrior to going \"live\" on DNAV, a fund must meet certain data eligibility requirements which includes being set up on certain related services/tools (e.g., Expense Manager, Income Change, GL Alerts, etc.). Given the eligibility requirements, not all funds are currently using the DNAV service.\nUpon meeting the DNAV requirements, authorized personnel instruct the BOAT or the eHorizon Deployment Team (as applicable) to set up the fund on DNAV and EDW by either providing a fund number to \"clone\" or by submitting an eHorizon Fund Level Service Setup Request Form (which includes workflow specific to the fund, live date, fund type, etc.). Fund Accounting personnel perform a weekly review of funds set up on DNAV and communicate approval or submit required changes to the Global Delivery Simplification Team.\nCritical Alerts\nCertain alerts generated through DNAV tools are classified as \"critical alerts.\" Critical alerts are automatically generated when transaction-related tolerances are exceeded/breached. Critical alerts require the initial reviewer to investigate, research and resolve alerts by posting a response. A second individual must review the response and either approve or reject the response for further investigation. An approval is required before the alert is \"cleared.\"\nEvent Driven Workflow (\"EDW\")\nUpon completion of the set-up on DNAV, funds are able to leverage EDW functionality. EDW is a service which uses event-based operations to automate the processing of the NAV and reduce manual intervention. EDW leverages MyView/Process Monitor to link events (called \"Milestones\") together to trigger subsequent processing. Events that do not complete automatically appear in a critical status in MyView/Process Monitor to be actioned before processing can continue. Reversal and reprocessing logic is built in to ensure accurate deliverables. Critical alerts are generated throughout the processing of each of the EDW milestones described below.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 85",

MCH automatically marks to market the foreign denominated balance sheet accounts (e.g., interest receivable, dividends, payables/receivable and security holdings, etc.) using either the current or prior day's exchange rate (based on the fund's setup) according to how the fund is set up in the system. The associated unrealized appreciation/depreciation is automatically posted to the fund's general ledger. The MyView status screen is automatically updated if mark-to-market does not complete. A critical alert is automatically generated and reported in DAS if the appreciation/depreciation for forward or spot contracts exceeds a predefined tolerance. Alerts are investigated, researched and resolved by designated personnel based on predefined criteria. A second individual reviews the resolution response and approves the closure of the alert.\nHedge Workflow\nHedge Workflow automatically posts currency hedging transactions from the hedge sleeve to the related parent share class. Hedge Workflow posts settled cash, realized gain/loss and unrealized gain/loss from the hedge sleeve to the corresponding parent share class. Failed postings appear in MyView. eHorizon automatically generates an alert if the sum of the corresponding parent class balances do not agree to the child class (hedge sleeve) balances. Daily priced funds automatically generate a critical alert that is reported in DAS if the impact of the hedge entries exceeds a predefined tolerance for funds that make the specific election.\nFor certain clients domiciled in the U.K., eHorizon systematically calculates the amount of the income/capital split.\nFlexible Fund Cycle\nThe flexible fund cycle automation within MCH allows fund groups to calculate fund NAV at any time on any day. The fund's accounting records can be closed and rolled forward at any time during a day with month end or year end falling on any business day independent of scheduled cycles. Same-day client reporting is available upon the close of the fund.\nFund transactions including corporate actions received prior to the designated closing time are automatically posted on MCH to the current accounting period. Fund transactions including corporate actions received after the designated closing time are automatically posted to the next accounting period. Fund closing accuracy controls (e.g., eHorizon, OSA-ASA audits) are completed by Global Accounting personnel based on the designated closing time and are reviewed for accuracy and completeness by supervisory personnel.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n88",

(\"SSBL\") uses custody and accounting applications described in this report. Controls in place are designed to determine whether there is adequate segregation of duties between custody functions (maintaining custody of securities; collecting dividend and interest income; receiving notification of corporate actions and recording such corporate actions; and recording and settling securities purchases and sales transactions in the custody application) and portfolio accounting and valuation functions. Key central administration and custody functions are subject to separate preparation and review processes. Custody and accounting records are automatically reconciled with results reported through the appropriate management reports.\nWritten procedures describing operational standards have been established and communicated to SSBL employees. Specific custody and accounting procedures have been drawn up in relation to portfolio valuation, capital stock and trade processing, compliance with investment policy and investment restrictions, NAV accuracy checks and other pertinent topics. Where some central administration functions are delegated to several parties, procedures also define the coordination and overall oversight performed by SSBL.\nSSBL uses a remote-access computing network for the execution of tasks in support of its custody and recordkeeping functions. SSBL has full access to the systems required to support its normal operations and can enter data and retrieve reports on a real-time basis. SSBL is fully aware of the operating conditions of the computer applications on which it relies and must give its consent for alterations to the applications that impact Luxembourg operations.\nLuxembourg investment funds and structures are required to send financial data on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to the Luxembourg regulators and/or supervisory bodies (i.e., BCL, CSSF).

The format of the proof package may be modified to suit a particular type of fund or client; management-level personnel approve any modifications to the standard package. The completed period-end proof packages are provided to Financial Reporting. For Australia and in-scope locations in Europe, the preparation and review of MAPS and/or LSL reporting is performed by Financial Reporting, Global Accounting and other related business units (i.e., custody, depositary/trustee, etc.).\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 90",

Prospective borrowers are approved in accordance with State Street's ERM guidelines. Borrower participation in the Securities Finance Program requires execution of a comprehensive borrower agreement that specifies acceptable types and percentages of collateral coverage, custody of collateral, securities subject to the lending program and risk of loss and risk bearer. Completed borrower start-up forms must be reviewed and approved by various levels of Securities Finance management prior to entry into the DML application, the primary application used by Securities Finance for the lending of client portfolio securities. Input into DML is reviewed for accuracy by appropriate personnel.\nLender participation in the Securities Finance Program requires execution of a comprehensive lending contract. For new lenders, a requisite start-up form is completed that specifies investment vehicles for collateral investment, participating lender accounts and lender restrictions (borrower, collateral, security or settlement), and is reviewed and approved by personnel from various groups within Securities Finance and entered into the DML application. Lender modification forms are also reviewed and approved by personnel from various groups within Securities Finance and entered into the DML application.

Restrictions input to DML are reviewed for accuracy. Other restrictions may be monitored outside of DML by Securities Finance on a daily basis. The DML application tracks loan restrictions (regulatory, borrower or lender requested) and automatically removes the participating lender's restricted securities from the pool of available securities.\nA list of approved borrowers is available online for lenders to review for any affiliates or conflicts of interest. Securities Finance monitors open loans for compliance with lender and borrower restrictions regularly.\nLoan Processing\nSecurities Finance receives a request to borrow a security or hold a security to be loaned at a future date. The Securities Finance trader reviews the DML application to determine whether the requested security is available to be loaned currently or held for a future-dated loan. If Securities Finance designates a security to be held for loan at a later date, the hold status may be terminated if another broker requests a loan on the position. DML lists each fund that participates in securities lending and the securities available for lending. DML automatically calculates loan value and collateral required from the borrower. The trader verifies the amount of collateral required from the borrower based upon the collateral calculation performed by DML.\nThe loan is input by the trader into the DML application and assigned an internal reference number for tracking purposes (U.S. equity, international equity and corporate bond loans may also be entered automatically\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n95",

DML automatically determines the borrower's credit limit, availability of free securities, opening and daily margin requirements and loan concentration based on lender restrictions. DML automatically notifies the settlement area of the loan.\nDML automatically allocates the loaning of securities based upon an established portfolio queue. This allows for a fair and weighted allocation of loans based on the amount of securities the portfolios have available to lend. Operations and trading personnel have the ability to override the automated queuing process under prescribed circumstances. User access to process override transactions is limited to specific personnel and access is controlled by the respective employee's manager. Overrides are processed to assist in loan processing in certain circumstances, including but not limited to, corporate actions and market restrictions. Users that have access to process overrides are reviewed annually for appropriateness based on job responsibility. Users are required to enter a mandatory reason code in DML when processing override transactions. Mandatory reason codes are established and approved by the Securities Finance compliance department. Once a loan has been entered into DML, the loaned security is delivered to the borrower through the various clearing organizations. Failing loans are monitored, researched and resolved by the appropriate settlement desk.\nFor borrower requests received electronically, DML automatically matches loan requests to portfolios by CUSIP and description, and loans on securities are allocated and granted. Any loans granted are executed based on predetermined rebate rules and dependent upon lender and borrower criteria.\nLoan Maintenance and Borrower Agreement Monitoring\nGlobal Income Services is responsible for tracking income receivables on loaned securities. Daily, Global Income Services generates claim sheets for income receivables identified on loaned securities. After claim sheets are distributed, the income receivables are reviewed with the borrower by Global Income Services. The borrower remits payment to Global Income Services directly. The details of these conversations may be documented in the SLCP tracking tool (\"SLCP\").\nGlobal Delivery Corporate Actions is responsible for the processing of corporate actions. Corporate action announcements are received from Corporate Actions Processing via a feed into SLE. Corporate action notifications are compared to lending activity. Securities that are affected by corporate actions are subject to lending activity restrictions. Required modifications are processed to the on-loan positions in DML, or the securities are called back from the borrower. Lender entitlements are collected from the borrowers and distributed to client accounts.\nDaily, as part of a multi-step reconciliation process, Securities Finance personnel reconcile several processes which include a reconciliation of daily transactions (loans, loan terminations and mark-to-markets) with each borrower, a reconciliation of daily collateral transactions with each borrower (cash and non-cash collateral) and a final collateral reconciliation to DML. Included in these reconciliations is the process of verifying the DML\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n96",

Securities Finance's cash totals for all borrower transaction sheets are reconciled to depository systems and are reconciled to the appropriate group's cash and security collateral accounts. Reconciliations are reviewed for accuracy by a second individual.\nFor lenders who are also custody clients of State Street, DML on-loan security positions are reconciled to SMAC/GSMAC on-loan positions via Duco. Differences are researched and resolved. For lenders who are not custody clients of State Street, DML on-loan security positions are matched to custodian on-loan positions per statements received from the third-party custodian via Duco. Differences are researched and resolved regularly. Daily, Securities Finance reviews a reconciliation from external vendors (Loanet, Equilend or Pirum) comparing shares on loan, cash and rates, or a subset thereof, between State Street's DML application and the borrower's records. Exceptions identified on the reports are researched and resolved. In the event that a counterparty's records are not available on a given business day, Securities Finance works with the external vendor and/or counterparty to receive the records and, upon receipt, review the relevant reconciliation and perform timely research and resolution of exceptions identified.\nCollateral Maintenance\nThe loan's collateral amount is determined during loan negotiations. Collateral receipt is confirmed through review of Hogan/IBS and SMAC/GSMAC or reporting from the tri-party custodian. To monitor borrower exposure on a daily basis, loan market value is compared to collateral market value for each broker account in the aggregate and individual loan level. If the borrower is not adequately collateralized, the borrower is contacted and required to deliver additional collateral. Securities Finance performs an End-of-Day Proof Balance Sheet that reconciles DML activity for the day, including mark-to-market adjustments, by broker on DML. This reconciliation is secondarily reviewed. Daily feeds from Global Pricing Services automatically update the loaned security prices or where market practice dictates an internationally recognized pricing source may be used. DML systematically recalculates the collateralization threshold and automatically determines if additional collateral is required. Securities Finance completes a reconciliation via Duco of the required collateral per DML to the non-cash collateral received per SMAC/GSMAC the following day. Exceptions are researched and resolved.\nCollateral Investment and Monitoring\nCash collateral is invested in the investment vehicle authorized by the lender per the lender's approved start-up form or subsequent modification forms. On a daily basis, Securities Finance accountants reconcile cash collateral balances per DML to the investment manager's balance for the investment vehicle per Spire and a secondary review is performed via the Manager's Check file.

Pending trades are authorized prior to release and confirmation of security delivery is monitored through online review of settlement on the Global One system which receives settlement messages from SMAC and GSMAC Custody applications. Prime Services traders monitor the borrows to confirm that orders are filled prior to the settlement deadline. Securities that are borrowed via Equilend are recorded automatically onto Global One.\nFor non-custody clients, a borrow request is received and the Prime Services desk negotiates to borrow the securities from a lender for delivery on settlement date. The borrow and loan are either systematically input onto Global One by the ITP application or input by the trader onto Global One and assigned an internal reference number for tracking purposes.

The solution includes a portal as well as API connectivity to allow State Street clients to submit account opening requests, manage renewals and other market initiatives. This digitized workflow offers internal/external dashboards for transparency into account opening and AML/KYC status, which can also be linked directly to its client's platform or ecosystem of choice through API.\n4. Cybersecurity Program\nState Street's Global Cybersecurity (\"GCS\") organization defines and manages the enterprise-wide Information Security Program. GCS partners with IT, corporate offices, and business units to implement controls designed to protect information assets. State Street's program currently aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") Special Publication 800 53R4 Standard.\nThe components of the program are:\nCybersecurity Center\n\u00b7 Analyzes areas such as authentication activities, risky privilege combinations, unusual printing activity, suspicious and/or inappropriate web activity, data leakage vulnerabilities, unusual web use, etc.\n\u00b7 Performs analysis of correlated events to more fully understand behavior and proactively identify scenarios that could lead to abuse.\n\u00b7 Creates actionable reporting for management, focusing on identification of emerging threats and opportunities to enhance management of security.\nCyber Defense Center\n\u00b7 Consists of a 24x7x365 Security Operations Center (\"SOC\") together with a Cyber Fusion Center, which jointly focus on enhancing network security monitoring and providing an agile, dynamic response capability. These resources allow State Street to perform near real-time monitoring of security events to identify and address risky and suspicious activity. The SIEM suite of tools collects log data from the firewall, performs intrusion detection/prevention, uses proxy and other security logging tools and generates security-related alerts as they occur. The SIEM monitors inbound and outbound web traffic, as fed to the SIEM through SSC system monitoring data feeds, to detect malicious web activity and provide a defense against shareware, malware and access to unauthorized software. Identified issues are reported centrally to the Security Operations Center and IT management.\n\u00b7 Provides cybersecurity monitoring, event correlation and security incident management across IT infrastructure elements.\n\u00b7 Regularly analyzes security information from multiple sources and industry forums to identify potential vulnerabilities.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION V\n2",

Four external organizations, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (\"FS-ISAC\"), the Financial Systemic Analysis and Resilience Center (\"FSARC\"), the Analysis and Resilience Center (\"ARC\"] for systemic risk and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (\"FSSCC\"), serve as the basis by which the financial services sector develops critical infrastructure protection policy and shares cybersecurity and other threat data.\n5. Privacy and Data Protection Program\nThe Corporate Compliance Oversight Program supports State Street's compliance with laws and regulations that apply to its global business activities and functions. The program cultivates a culture in which compliance is an integral part of State Street's business environment and is recognized and rewarded in evaluating the performance of its business units and its employees.\nAs part of that effort, State Street has implemented the Global Privacy and Personal Data Protection Standard (\"Privacy Standard\") to address the practices that must be adhered to by all employees globally in order to comply with regulatory privacy and data protection requirements and best practices. The Privacy Standard has global applicability, and addresses certain jurisdictional implications and details, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 The coverage of the policy (processing and controlling of data, including collection of data and data minimization concepts)\n\u00b7 Roles and responsibilities\n\u00b7 Personal data protection principles\n\u00b7 Cross-border data transfers\n\u00b7 Breach management\n\u00b7 Privacy by design\n\u00b7 Data subject rights requests\n\u00b7 Sharing personal data with third parties\nJurisdictional-specific guidance is in place in countries where additional obligations are imposed by law or common practice in the financial services industry.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION V\n3",

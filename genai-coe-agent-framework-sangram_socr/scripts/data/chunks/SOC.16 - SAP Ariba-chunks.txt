        "content": "KPMG\nKPMG LLP 1601 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19103-2499\nIndependent Service Auditors' Report\nManagement of SAP SE:\nScope\nWe have examined management of SAP SE's (SAP) accompanying description of its Ariba System (the System) for processing user entities' transactions throughout the period October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 titled \"Management of SAP's Description of its Ariba System\" (the Description) and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls included in the Description to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on the criteria identified in \"Management of SAP SE's Assertion\" (the Assertion). The controls and control objectives included in the Description are those that management of SAP believes are likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting, and the Description does not include those aspects of the System that are not likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting.\nThe information included in Section V, \"Other Information Provided by Management of SAP\", is presented by management of SAP to provide additional information and is not a part of the Description. Information about SAP's management's responses to exceptions identified in the report has not been subjected to the procedures applied in the examination of the Description and of the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.\nSAP uses the subservice organizations identified in Section III to perform some of the services provided to user entities that are likely to be relevant to those user entities' internal control over financial reporting. The Description includes only the control objectives and related controls of SAP and excludes the control objectives and related controls of the subservice organizations. The Description also indicates that certain control objectives specified by SAP can be achieved only if complementary subservice organization controls assumed in the design of SAP's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with the related controls at SAP. Our examination did not extend to controls of the subservice organizations, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.\nThe Description indicates that certain control objectives specified in the Description can be achieved only if complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of SAP's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with related controls at SAP. Our examination did not extend to such complementary user entity controls, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary user entity controls.\nService Organization's Responsibilities\nIn Section II, management of SAP has provided the Assertion about the fairness of the presentation of the Description and suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description. SAP is responsible for preparing the Description and Assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the Description and Assertion, providing the services covered by the Description, specifying the control objectives and stating them in the Description, identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives, selecting the criteria stated in the Assertion, and designing, implementing, and documenting controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\nService Auditors' Responsibilities\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the Description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on our examination.\nKPMG LLP a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.",

        "content": "KPMG\nOur examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, based on the criteria in the Assertion, the Description is fairly presented and the controls were suitably designed and operated effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description throughout the period October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our qualified opinion.\nAn examination of a description of a service organization's system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls involves:\n. performing procedures to obtain evidence about the fairness of the presentation of the description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the description, based on the criteria in management's assertion\n\u2022 assessing the risks that the description is not fairly presented and that the controls were not suitably designed or operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the description\n\u00b7 testing the operating effectiveness of those controls that management considers necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the related control objectives stated in the description were achieved\n\u00b7 evaluating the overall presentation of the description, suitability of the control objectives stated in the description, and suitability of the criteria specified by the service organization in its assertion.\nWe are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in the United States of America relating to the examination engagement. We have complied with those requirements. We have also applied the statements on quality control standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control. The firm also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nInherent Limitations\nThe Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their auditors who audit and report on user entities' financial statements and may not, therefore, include every aspect of the System that each individual user entity may consider important in its own particular environment. Because of their nature, controls at a service organization may not prevent, or detect and correct, all misstatements in processing or reporting transactions. Also, the projection to the future of any evaluation of the fairness of the presentation of the Description, or conclusions about the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, is subject to the risk that controls at a service organization may become ineffective.\nDescription of Tests of Controls\nThe specific controls tested and the nature, timing, and results of those tests are listed in Section IV.\nBasis for Qualified Opinion\nIn Section III, SAP states that users' access is removed timely upon termination. However, the control to remove access for terminated users did not include procedures to monitor that the job which updates the identity access management system processes termination data from the employee and external worker systems on a timely basis. Also as stated in Section III, effective April 1, 2023, SAP implemented a quarterly review control to identify and assess post-termination login activity and review inappropriate events for internal employees and external workers. Consequently, the controls were not suitably designed or operating effectively during the period of October 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 to achieve the control objective \"Controls provide reasonable assurance that logical access to production systems and data files is restricted to authorized personnel.\"\n3",

With more than 400,000 customers in more than 180 countries, the SAP Group employs more than 105,000 staff in over 140 countries. SAP's end-to-end suite of applications and services enables customers to operate profitably and continuously adapt.\nDescription of the Services Provided\nSAP Ariba solutions enable customers to source, contract, procure, pay, manage, and analyze spend and supplier relationships. Customers use the applications to control spend and drive continuous improvements in financial and supply-chain performance.\nSAP Ariba provides the following solutions\n\u00b7 SAP Ariba Strategic Sourcing solutions is used to manage entire sourcing, contracting, and spend analysis processes for all types of procurement. Customers can create a sourcing project or event.\n. SAP Ariba Procurement Solutions are used to manage spend-related processes. Additionally, customers can integrate the solution to their back-end system to process invoices and payments.\n. SAP Business Network is a hosted service that enables suppliers and buyers to conduct transactions over the internet.\n. SAP Ariba Cloud Integration Gateway allows customers to integrate SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA back-end systems with trading partners and SAP Ariba solutions.\nReferences to \"SAP Ariba\" throughout this report refer to the Line of Business (LoB) within SAP.\nAriba System Topology\nThe SAP Ariba System is offered as a public cloud, multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). SAP Ariba hosts multiple customers on a load-balanced farm of identical instances, with each customer's data kept logically segregated, and with configurable metadata for customers. The SAP Ariba Cloud Solutions are scalable to a large number of customers because the number of servers and instances on the back end can be increased or decreased as necessary to match demand, without requiring additional re-architecting of the application. Changes or fixes can be rolled out to thousands of tenants. In SAP Ariba's technical terminology, the term \"tenant\" is rarely used; instead, \"realm\" is used in the context of the on- demand buyer applications and \"customer accounts\" is used in reference to the SAP Ariba Network. SAP Ariba uses the term \"tenant\" to refer to the general concepts, which apply to both cases.\n9",

        "content": "SAP\nE\nInformation Systems Security\nThis section describes the end-to-end security architecture model for the SAP Ariba solutions. SAP Ariba Operations has standardized operating system installations based on predefined security policies. Servers are configured with just the applications and services required to run the server as designed. Services that are not required are disabled and binary files that are not required for operations are removed, which reduces the total number of vulnerabilities a system may have.\nSAP Ariba Operations' standardized installation process also helps ensure that servers of the same type are configured in the same manner, utilizing a process that initiates an upgrade to system binaries across all systems. Based on the system type, the configuration will remain the same. If one server type needs to receive a patch for a vulnerable binary file, that patch is pushed to all systems of that server type. If that binary exists on all systems, it is patched across all systems. Patches are then included in the build process as well so that future systems built will follow security standards. SAP Ariba uses this configuration process to harden the operating system prior to implementing additional controls, as detailed below.\nWeb Servers. Authentication using a unique login/password pair is required when SAP Ariba users attempt to access corporate profile information, initiate a transaction, or retrieve information saved from a previous session. HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) is based on a minimum 128-bit encryption and is used for secure communications between the web browsers and the web servers.\nLoad Balancers. SAP Ariba load balancers control traffic and provide optimal utilization of webservers. Although they are not considered a security component, the load balancers provide access control functionality to help ensure authorized traffic flow. Access control entries (ACEs) deny all traffic through the load balancers except traffic between the internal interface of the firewall and the external interface of the web servers. ACEs also deny traffic that is not using one of the required protocols for firewall-to-web server communications.\nMonitoring Servers. SAP Ariba uses a centralized monitoring server for alerting capabilities. It monitors network traffic, processes system messages and alerts, application status and transaction status.\nRouters. Routers are the primary networking components in SAP Ariba. They coordinate the delivery of data packets between the various system components while providing several essential security controls and features. Routers provide packet filtering by creating access control lists (ACLs) that define the types of data packets (protocol, source, and destination) allowed to pass through the router interfaces. Data packets that do not meet the criteria specified in the ACLs are rejected.\nFirewalls. Firewalls separate the SAP Ariba corporate network from SAP Ariba infrastructure computers. Therefore, unauthorized SAP Ariba employees cannot access SAP Ariba data from the SAP Ariba corporate network infrastructure. Access is limited to specific roles or functions within SAP Ariba Operations. Additionally, access is managed on an exception basis whereby personnel need clearance to be authorized as external connections. Access is time-limited, after which re-authentication is required.\nIntrusion Detection System. SAP Ariba uses network and host-based intrusion detection. This technology provides logging and alert capabilities to assist in the detection of malicious acts and misuse. Intrusion detection/prevention tools are used to identify, log, and report potential security breaches and other incidents. An automated script generates an intrusion alert which is reviewed by management.\n13",

        "content": "SAP\nSeparation of Customer Data\nIn the SAP Ariba Cloud Solutions environment, tenants share certain resources; however, their private data is isolated. All tenants share the same version of the application software. This means that only one version of the application is deployed for production use in a data center. Multiple tenants share the same hardware resources, the same applications server instances, and the same storage. Even though resources are shared between tenants, the data of each tenant is always isolated. SAP Ariba stores the data of multiple tenants in the same database tables, separated by the tenants' organizational and user IDs.\nComponents of the System Used to Provide the Services\nInfrastructure\nSAP Ariba is deployed in different regions. It is deployed on Google Cloud Platform in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia . It is deployed on SAP Cloud Infrastructure in China, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Each regional data center hosts the full SAP Ariba application suite, including all SAP Ariba Procure-to-Pay and Strategic Sourcing applications. The SAP Business Network is considered to be a transit network, like the internet, supporting connectivity between organizations and serving as a central marketplace. This shared resource is housed in SAP Ariba's North America data centers and colocation data centers. Application connectivity between the sites in North America, Europe, China, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Australia and Japan is over the public network with secure HTTPS connections.\nWithin each region, SAP Ariba has deployed two data centers that act as redundant pairs. These data centers are built in a warm stand-by configuration. At any point in time, customers interact with servers in a single data center while data is copied in near real time to the other. For GCP and SAP Cloud Infrastructure, the underlying physical infrastructure is managed by Google and SAP Cloud Infrastructure (SCI) respectively and the software and virtual components are managed by SAP Ariba. For the purposes of this report, GCP and SAP Cloud Infrastructure (SCI) are subservice organizations. Controls at the respective subservice organizations are not included in the scope of the report.\n<table><tr><th>Global Region</th><th>Primary DC Operated by</th><th>Data Center ID</th><th>Location</th><th>Data Center ID</th><th>Secondary DC\nOperated by</th><th>Location</th></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>XG1</td><td>Council Bluffs, Iowa</td><td>XGO</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>Las Vegas, Nevada</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>XGA</td><td>Sydney, Australia</td><td>XGA Zonal DR</td><td>Google Cloud Platform- Zonal level DR</td><td>Sydney, Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Europe</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>XGB</td><td>Frankfurt, Germany</td><td>XGH</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>Eemshaven, Netherlands</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>XG9</td><td>Tokyo, Japan</td><td>XGJ</td><td>Google Cloud Platform</td><td>Osaka, Japan</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>SAP Cloud Infrastructure</td><td>SHA3</td><td>Shanghai, China</td><td>SHA4</td><td>SAP Cloud Infrastructure</td><td>Shanghai, China</td></tr><tr><td>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</td><td>SAP Cloud Infrastructure</td><td>RI1</td><td>Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</td><td>DM1</td><td>SAP Cloud Infrastructure</td><td>Dammam, Saudi Arabia</td></tr></table> \n\n\n14",

        "content": "SAP\nProcedures\nSAP Global Security has developed the SAP Security Policy Framework, which comprises the security-relevant requirements and implementation guidelines for business units and subsidiaries of the company. The framework is built on the following structure:\n\u00b7 Security Policy: A high-level document that defines management strategy, expectations, and direction. It establishes the strategic goals and objectives that the organization strives to achieve in order to maintain the highest level of security.\n. Security Standards: A document that defines the minimum requirements for adherence to a policy. These requirements can be met by executing the corresponding procedure(s).\n. Security Procedures: A series of sequential tasks that are performed to achieve an outcome. Procedures can be the step-by-step instructions to implement a standard when appropriate.\n. Security Good Practices: A checklist for employees to simplify the policy implementation process.\nRefer to the \"Overview of Processes\" section for additional information on policies and procedures used across the various aspects of the control environment.\nData\nThe following describes the different types of data used by SAP Ariba Cloud solutions:\n. Master Data: Master data are data that are relatively static and represent a common point of reference. Examples of master data in an SAP Ariba cloud solution are:\n- Employee (user) data\n- Organizational hierarchy and accounting data\n- Product information, including pricing\n- Payment terms\n- Supplier company name, address, and other identification information\n- Customer identification information\n- Currency information\n- Unit of measure information\nThe specific master data supported and required depends on the customer's SAP Ariba cloud solution and business process requirement. For a full list of available master data, see the product documentation of the respective customer solution. Most master data can be imported and synced with the customer's back-end system.\nTransaction Data: Typical transactions in SAP Ariba cloud solutions include purchase orders, order confirmations, invoices, service sheets, and payment advice documents. A transaction describes a specific event, such as sending a purchase order to a supplier or alerting a supplier that payment of an invoice has been approved.\nProject Data: Project data is a type of transaction data for SAP Ariba Strategic Sourcing solutions. Project data includes sourcing events such as requests for information (RFI), requests for proposal (RFP), or auction events or contract data consisting of contract workspaces, documents, clauses, and tasks.\n17",

It sets the tone of the organization and influences the control consciousness of its personnel. The components of the control environment include integrity and ethical values, management's commitment to competence, the organizational structure, the assignment of authority and responsibility, and the oversight and direction provided by the management of SAP.\nSAP Code of Business Conduct\nSAP defines standards for conduct in business, legal, and ethical matters carried out on a daily business. The Code of Business Conduct is reviewed and acknowledged by each employee as part of the new hire onboarding and annually thereafter. Employees are notified of amendments to the Code of Business Conduct via the corporate portal and email.\nCorporate Governance\nThe SAP SE Supervisory Board (\"Supervisory Board\") is an independent governing and supervising body that provides oversight and strategic direction for the organization. The size and the composition of the Supervisory Board are determined by the Articles of Incorporation and the Agreement of the Involvement of the European Employees in SAP SE. SAP's Supervisory Board is comprised of members elected by the shareholders at their General Meeting and members representing the European employees of the SAP Group.\nThe Supervisory Board has defined a catalogue of skills and expertise collectively required of its members so that it possesses the knowledge, ability and professional experience required to properly perform its function.\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed committees to prepare its deliberations and implement resolutions. Information about each Supervisory Board member, and the Committees and their composition, is available on the company website.\nOn an annual basis, the status of internal controls is formally reported to management and the Supervisory Board. The report details assessment results, as well as related follow-up activities.\nIn addition, SAP has an independent Internal Audit function reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer of SAP SE, and the Supervisory Board's Audit and Compliance Committee. SAP's audit charter defines Internal Audit's purpose, authority, responsibility, and position.

The SAP Global Risk Management Policy communicates the SAP Executive Board's expectations on how risks are to be managed within SAP. It sets out company-wide standards for managing risk across the Lines of Business (LoBs) and establishes the key risk management responsibilities within SAP.\nThe Global Risk Management Policy defines risk management methodologies, activities, and organizational requirements for achieving the policy objectives. SAP's risk management model comprises of five process steps:\n\u00b7 Risk Planning\n\u00b7 Risk Identification\n\u00b7 Risk Analysis\n\u00b7 Risk Response\n\u00b7 Risk Monitoring\nSAP performs risk assessments to identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against criteria published in the SAP Global Risk Management Policy. Each cloud service performs risk assessments in alignment with the Global Risk Management policy and guidelines. Risks that exceed a certain level of risk exposure are documented in the Central Risk Repository (GRC Software Solution). Each risk is then mitigated to an acceptable level, or the risk is accepted in accordance with the Global Risk Management Policy. Risks may be accepted if, for example, the cost of implementing the mitigation exceeds the risk exposure or business impact.\nSupplier Management\nThe objective of the Supplier Management process is to provide assurance that critical suppliers adhere to the agreed level of security and service delivery.\nThe compliance of subservice organizations with SAP's security requirements is periodically reviewed and verified by SAP audit procedures. Certain control objectives can be met only if the subservice organization's controls, assumed in the design of SAP's controls, are suitably designed, and operate effectively along with related controls at SAP.\nCritical suppliers are identified as those who have access/potential access to customer data and those who are critical for the continuation of operations.

Evidence (audit reports, certificates, etc.) is requested from the suppliers if additional compliance requirements need to be fulfilled.\nNew suppliers are screened against the Sanction Party List, which is a list of persons and companies with whom trade is prohibited by law. New suppliers that have access to production data and/or process customer data for Cloud Services (also called \"critical suppliers\") are subject to specific checks required by SAP's Global Procurement Organization depending on the type of the supplier. New, critical suppliers with access to personal and/or confidential data of SAP or SAP's customers are required to complete a data processing enablement process or Third-Party Risk Management process.\nData Center Audits\nSAP-owned and co-located data centers hosting productive customer systems are audited in accordance with the SAP Compliance Framework at least every two years.\nInternal SAP data center auditors coordinate and perform physical security audits of co-located data centers. When physical data center audits are completed, the auditors create a report that is reviewed with the responsible person at the data center.\nA data center audit follows a standard procedure, including a check of the adherence to internal requirements, resulting in an audit report.\nNon-compliance is documented, tracked, and followed up in SAP's central managed ticketing system. For each documented issue, a risk mitigation response is mandatory. The issues are also communicated to the data center provider to help ensure that mandatory requirements are met. If an issue is deemed acceptable by SAP, the acceptance of the remaining risk is documented within the ticket.\nReview of Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) Provider Compliance Documents\nPeriodic reviews of laaS attestation reports and/or compliance documents are performed to detect compliance issues.

        "content": "SAP\nOverview of Processes\nThe following section provides an overview of the processes in scope for this report.\nBackup and Restore\nThe objective of the Backup and Restore process is to back up (copy) and store data in remote locations where it is protected until needed, such as when a loss of data has occurred, and the data must be restored. The Backup and Restore process is supported by Backup and Restore services, which help ensure the integrity of customers' data by restoring corrupted data when necessary.\nThe loss of data can have a significant impact on IT systems. Loss or corruption of business data or customer master data can even threaten the existence of a company. Similarly, if key data is lost or is corrupted at a company, it can delay administrative or operational activities, or even bring them to a complete standstill. The Backup and Restore process mitigates these kinds of risks. The following process describes why and how backups are taken, how the data is protected and how backups are restored.\nData can be lost for many reasons:\n\u00b7 Demagnetization of magnetic data carriers as a result of aging or unsuitable ambient conditions (temperature, air humidity)\n\u00b7 Interference on magnetic data carriers caused by external magnetic fields\n\u00b7 Destruction of data carriers through natural disasters\n\u00b7 Inadvertent deletion or overwriting of files\n\u00b7 Technical failures on peripheral memories (head crash)\n\u00b7 Defective data carriers\n\u00b7 Uncontrolled changes to stored data (integrity loss)\n\u00b7 Deliberate destruction of data by computer viruses\nThe Backup and Restore process is based on the SAP Security Policy Framework, which follows SAP's Cloud Infrastructure Security Procedure and Key Management Security Procedure.\nThere are two processes for protecting data: Backup Management and Restore Management.\nBackup Management\nBackup agents are installed and backup jobs are scheduled on the corresponding database server. An initial full database backup is performed. After the successful initial backup, the new system is integrated into the landscape and the backup status is monitored via the respective monitoring tool.\nBackups are performed on a regular basis for in-scope production systems. Relevant backup database systems are monitored on a daily basis. If backups are not running or encounter errors, backup error alerts are generated. The alerts are addressed within predefined timeframes and corrective actions are initiated and documented. Errors are either resolved by the Backup team or forwarded to the appropriate support group if needed.\n30",

        "content": "SAP\nBackup data is encrypted according to SAP policies and standards in accordance with the requirements related to the data being backed up. Encryption keys are managed and protected against modification and unauthorized disclosure.\nBackup data is stored on two different backup devices physically located in different data centers. This is achieved via replication. However, during the period October 1, 2022 to October 22, 2022, SAP Ariba did not have encryption enabled for the replication communication channel.\nRestore Management\nCustomers or customer representatives from cloud units (restore requestor) can request restores by submitting a Service Request (SR) in the respective ticketing system. The restore requestor must use the corresponding template and provide the necessary information.\nThe Restore Processor receives and validates the restore requirements, validates that the restore requestor is authorized to request the restore and documents the results in the ticket. If the validation fails, the SR is rejected, and the Restore Processor provides the reasons for the rejection. If the validation is successful, the Restore Processor proceeds with the restore. The Restore Processor checks that the backup data and backup media are available as required to perform the restore.\nThe Restore Processor documents the successful completion of the restore procedure in the ticket. The Restore Requestor can manually confirm the restore success. If this is not performed manually, the ticket will be confirmed automatically within a predefined timeframe. To validate the reliability of the backup media and restore process, data restoration functionality testing is performed at least annually. The testing procedures and results are documented.\nChange Management\nThe objective of the Change Management process is to provide reasonable assurance that changes to the production environment are authorized, tested, approved, and implemented in a controlled manner.\nOverview\nSAP Ariba follows a Product Lifecycle Methodology (PLM) for product development. The methodologies vary slightly depending on product maturity and the type of development (e.g. new applications versus incremental features). In all cases, the methodologies define:\n\u00b7 Specific phases, activities, and deliverables.\n\u00b7 Entry and exit criteria, including reviewing feature completeness, quality trends, test case execution, and test case automation, as well as security reviews.\n\u00b7 Formal exit reviews, with final approval by SAP Ariba Products Development leadership or their delegates.\nSAP Ariba's development process is based on the Agile development methodology, with cross- functional teams called \"feature teams\" or \"scrum teams.\" Since requirements are difficult to capture in documents, Agile concentrates on having constantly running software in development that can be iterated quickly. Feature teams are responsible for planning and delivering sets of related features. Those teams typically include members from Development, Quality Assurance, Product Management, User Assistance, Globalization, and Readiness. In\n31",

Feature-Based Development: New features and enhancements are developed independently utilizing Agile with Scrum for execution.\n. Sustaining: Production defects are reviewed and resolved under a controlled change management process. Critical defects are fixed via hot fixes (HFs) or data fixes. Other important fixes are addressed via regularly scheduled service packs.\nSAP Ariba releases software updates on a frequent basis to customers. Each release contains:\n\u00b7 Feature-based development features\n\u00b7 Incubation features\n\u00b7 Defect fixes\nSAP Ariba typically deploys one consolidated customer-facing release per month containing:\n. SAP Ariba Applications: A release that delivers updates to SAP Ariba Sourcing and Procurement Solutions\n. SAP Ariba Network: A release that delivers updates to the Ariba Network\nTo help ensure customers know what each release contains, a release information is published to customers that includes a bill of materials (BOM) that highlights the content contained in the release.\nIn addition, SAP Ariba may deploy additional releases of underlying infrastructure applications that are not directly exposed to the customer. These releases support the Sourcing, Procurement, and Network solutions.\nFeature-Based Development Model\nA key aspect of feature-based development is that features are developed and deployed independently. Once a feature has met the exit criteria and has been approved, it is considered ready for production. Teams will frequently work on multiple features concurrently. In some cases, a collection of features may have cross-dependencies, as in the case when a new internal service is being delivered for the first time.\nPlanning\nIn feature-based development, features are reviewed, prioritized, and slotted for future sprints on a regular basis. This may be quarterly for some teams and as often as weekly for more dynamic teams.\nDevelopment\nThe Development phase is defined by a set of development sprints. A sprint is a fixed unit of time, where new units of functionality (\"use cases\") are added to SAP Ariba applications. Sprints are generally two to four weeks long. The result of each sprint is workable, demonstrable code that can be shown to customers for feedback. Features will be developed in one or more sprints.\n32",

Releases undergo a full qualification cycle with automated and manual testing and must meet specified exit criteria.\n\u00b7 Change requests (features, enhancements, and defect fixes) are tracked in Jira and all code changes are managed in a version control system (e.g. Perforce, GitHub).\nQuality Assurance\nSAP Ariba uses the following quality control processes and tools:\n\u00b7 Technical Reviews (during design and implementation)\n. Automated Testing and Manual Testing (including ad hoc testing)\n\u00b7 Performance and Stress Testing, as needed\nTechnical Reviews\nPrior to implementation, design reviews by either a principal Engineer or Architect are required. During implementation, a code review, performed by two reviewers, is required. Code cannot be checked in until both reviewers approve the code (system-enforced). Application changes are managed in GitHub and host level changes are managed by Perforce. Code reviews for Perforce are tracked within the Crucible code review tool.\nTesting\nSAP Ariba leverages an automation test suite (both unit and Ul-level). Automation also allows SAP Ariba to manage and maintain the release quality throughout the development lifecycle. The automation suite is run for every build during the full development lifecycle.\nIn addition to the automation suite, SAP Ariba executes a test suite of manual test cases. Each week, feature teams perform regular ad-hoc \"group\" testing on new functionality.\nCode is scanned using dynamic and static code scanning tools to identify potential security and code flaws.\n33",

        "content": "SAP\nSAP Ariba management reviews the pass rate for all releases for both automation and manual testing prior to approving a release.\nPerformance / Stress Testing\nPerformance testing, validation and monitoring are integral parts of the SAP Ariba development and production operational models for larger changes.\nDuring feature development, the design of every feature is reviewed for performance impacts. Where applicable, automated unit tests are written to help ensure critical performance measures are met as part of the feature development exit review.\nSAP Ariba executes performance testing in a lab environment to simulate the production environment. Two different types of testing are performed in this environment:\n\u00b7 Stress testing is a test suite designed to simulate production-like transactions under load (thousands of users over multiple realms/communities with 30 million catalogue items).\n\u00b7 Stability testing (or longevity testing) is a long-running test suite used to help ensure that there are no issues due to extended usage of the system.\nAfter product release, SAP Ariba has metrics that are constantly monitored to help ensure the performance of the production system from system level (memory, disk I/O, database connections, etc.) to the application level (page response times, business transitions, etc.). The SAP Ariba teams work with customers to understand their usage requirements to help ensure their needs are accounted for during production capacity planning and that production system performance standards are maintained during peak periods. Trend-based monitoring is used to track production system metrics and help ensure that there is sufficient capacity for ongoing growth.\nSAP Ariba PLM Adherence\nRegardless of the methodology followed, change control releases are documented within source code control systems such as Git or other document management systems such as the Confluence Wiki. This includes requirements, design, and test approach documents for all features. All test cases and results are documented and tracked.\nAll exit criteria, including release approval documents, are tracked in a document management system. All source code and important project documentation is kept in a version control system.\nFeatures undergo a security impact analysis before implementation.\nPrior to production implementation, all changes to applications, including emergency changes, require complete documentation based on established procedures and checklists with sign-off approval from Engineering Development management before the Production Operations team will apply the changes.\nAsset Management\nAsset Management includes a range of activities that allows SAP to manage the inventory and monitor assets related to the system during their lifecycle. This comprises assets located in SAP internal data centers, including physical and virtual servers. Core Asset Management activities rely on the integration of asset data across several Asset Management tools. Key attribute data for physical and virtual assets is recorded. Production assets are identified in an asset inventory.\n34",

A central catalogue of hyperscaler accounts utilized within SAP is maintained, providing information about key data elements. The tracking of this information allows for proper governance and security.\nInvoice Payment Processing\nThe objective of the Invoice Payment Processing process is to provide reasonable assurance that invoice and payment transactions are processed completely, accurately, and in a timely manner.\nData Validations: Data validations checks are done to help ensure data integrity for invoice payment processing. Ariba Network validates invoices according to the buyer-configured rules and rejects invoices that do not pass validation, e.g., Ariba Network validates online invoices during data entry and displays onscreen messages for any errors that must be corrected.\nErrors in Batch Payment: The application is configured to identify errors related to duplicate batch and unbalanced batch payments and provide notification to buyers when such errors occur.\nInvoice Reconciliation Exception: An invoice exception is a discrepancy between the data on the invoice and the data on the associated order, contract, or receipt. Invoice exceptions can represent a variety of issues, such as missing receipts, mismatched quantities or prices, duplicate invoices, or tax variances. Exceptions can occur at either the line-item level or the header level of an invoice and require manual intervention per the Invoice Exception configuration. User's group membership determines the invoice exceptions that user can reconcile.\nSupplier Bank Validation: Application is configured to validate supplier bank account before payment is processed. Invalid supplier accounts are detected, blocked for payment, and the buyer is notified.\nCustomers can refer to guides available on SAP Help for further details on SAP Ariba Invoice Payment processing.\nNetwork and Communication Management\nThe objective of the Network Communication and Security Architecture process is to provide security measures that prevent unauthorized logical access on the SAP Cloud Network levels where the customer systems are managed and run. The SAP Cloud Network is separated from the SAP Corporate Network via a firewall.\nFirewalls and Network Architecture\nFirewalls are implemented at the network level to help ensure that unauthorized network traffic is filtered, and security at the network level is provided. Changes to the filter set are approved, logged, and traceable to the user who performed the change. Firewall configurations are reviewed at least every quarter.\nNetwork architecture diagrams for the production environment include the design of security zones for network segmentation. These diagrams are documented and reviewed at least annually.\n35",

The intrusion detection/prevention solution provides logging and alert capabilities to assist in the detection of potentially malicious acts or misuse. Logs are sent to the central SIEM for triaging and tracking. The SAP Ariba Central Security team reviews logs generated by the intrusion detection/prevention sensors, and potential incidents are subsequently addressed, resolved, and reviewed by management. Palo Alto Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems provides additional vulnerability protection, network anti-malware and anti-spyware into one service that scans all traffic for threats - all ports, protocols, and encrypted traffic. This provides for scanning for threats at all points within the cyber-attack lifecycle, not just when it first enters the network - providing a layered defence, zero trust model with prevention at all points.\nPhysical Security\nOctober 1, 2022 to March 4, 2023\nThe objective of the Physical Security process is to help ensure that data centers are protected by adequate controls. These controls include facility and environmental security (for SAP- owned data centers), access controls, and integrated surveillance.\nFacility and Environmental Security\nA backup power supply is available for the SAP-owned data centers in case of primary power failure, the backup power generators are maintained on a regular basis. Proof of their maintenance is documented in a report provided by the supplier company.\nIn order to protect against damage from fire, the SAP-owned data centers are equipped with appropriate fire emergency systems, including smoke and heat sensors and fire extinguishers. To help ensure their functionality, the fire emergency systems are tested and maintained on a regular basis. Proof of their maintenance is documented in a report provided by the supplier company.\nThe climate control of the SAP-owned data centers is controlled via redundant air conditioning systems operating within a predefined temperature range. To help ensure functionality, the air conditioning systems are tested and maintained on a regular basis, which is documented by the supplier company in a report.\nAccess\nIn order to gain physical access to a data center, an individual with an SAP user ID should request the access via the Cloud Datacenter Access Workflow Tool. On a monthly basis, Global Physical Security and Data Center Management review access to SAP-owned and Colocation data centers for valid approval and appropriateness. Access that is no longer needed is removed in a timely manner. If necessary for terminations, a lookback analysis is performed to determine if there was unauthorized access to data centers.\nAccess is granted by the Supervisor or Cost Center Owner and the Local Area Owner. The access request, together with the approval, is stored in the Cloud Data center Access Workflow Tool. The access control system, SIPORT (Germany), is then used to manage the data center\n36",

The on-duty security staff are alerted via alarms when the motion sensors have detected movement. Motion sensors are maintained on a regular basis. Maintenance is documented by the supplier company in a report.\nThe areas surrounding the SAP-owned data center and facility buildings are monitored by security guards on a 24x7x365 basis using surveillance cameras. Surveillance cameras are maintained on a regular basis. Maintenance is documented by the supplier company in a report.\nIn some SAP-owned data centers, motion sensors are embedded in the surveillance cameras and, when activated, begin recording. The feeds from these cameras are monitored live 24x7 from a security operations center in the respective data centers. If footage is interrupted, the security operations center staff will triage, and if the feed cannot be restored, a service call is made to the supplier for rectification.\nUser and Access Management\nThe objective of the User and Access Management (UAM) process is to help ensure that logical access to the solutions' production systems and supporting tools is reasonable and restricted to properly SAP-authorized individuals.\nSAP has established and documented identity management, access control and password policies. These policies define password requirements and access controls to help maintain authorized user access and to prevent unauthorized access to information systems. The allocation and use of privileges are restricted and controlled. Appropriate authentication methods are used to control access by remote users.\nIdentity Management and Authentication\nAll users, SAP employees and external workers, have a unique identifier (user ID), and a suitable authentication technique is used to substantiate the user's claimed identity. These unique user identifiers are used whenever an employee or an external worker accesses production systems.\nSession management mechanisms are in place for to manage the lifecycle of user sessions.\nEmployee Central (EC) serves as the HR system for SAP employees, while Fieldglass (FG) functions as the HR system for external workers. SAP utilizes the SAP IT Identity Management System (SAP IT IDM) to synchronize SAP Global Activity Directory (SAP Global AD) daily, which is then used to access Safeguard for authenticating to production with role-based privileged credentials.\n37",

SAP Ariba's password settings are configured in accordance with the SAP Global Security Standard.\nA production access request workflow has been created to grant access to the production environment. Each production access request is required to be approved by the requestor's manager, the Security team and the Operations team. This is applicable to all type of users and roles such as System Administrators, Database Administrators, Network Engineers, and the Deployment and Tools teams. An SoD policy has been established for the various roles and each production access request is validated to help ensure that SoD is not violated.\nDevelopers do not have direct access to the production environment. The Dev/Test and Production environments are segregated. As per SoD, all code pushes to production can only be done by members of the Cloud Operations team.\nAccess to SAP Ariba Buyer and Business Network Supplier Mobile Applications\nFor the buyer mobile application, access requires authorized permission, which allows for activation of the user's mobile device with their user account. Login requires the use of a password. A user may optionally use phone-provided PIN or biometrics to access the application.\nFor the business network supplier mobile application, login requires a valid username and password. A user may optionally use phone-provided biometrics to access the application.\nAccess Revocation for Leavers and Job Transfers\nEmployees and external workers who leave SAP (leavers) are first identified by HR systems (EC for employees and FG for external workers) via employee termination dates and external worker close dates. FG via C-IDM (an intermediary system for external workers) and EC then interface the termination data to SAP IT IDM. SAP IT IDM synchronizes with SAP Global AD.\nThe deactivation of a user in AD prevents the user from logging into access management tool (Safeguard).\nAn automated script compares the Cloud Operations access management tool (Safeguard) with AD daily to identify user accounts of terminated employees. Jira tickets are created by the script when Safeguard accounts are found with no corresponding account in SAP's AD. Within seven business days, such accounts are deactivated by the responsible team in Cloud Operations.\nExternal workers are required to have a worker end date field populated in FG which cannot be set to greater than 13 months from the account creation or extension date. Once the worker end date is reached, or if the FG account status is manually disabled, an automated workflow within FG will trigger the user account deactivation process.\n38",

AS_AMON5 contained a design deficiency as the control did not fully monitor for data transfer issues for external worker leavers (terminations) from Fieldglass to IDM. As a result, this impacted the completeness and accuracy of the data that was critical to the performance of the AS_AMON6b and UAM04a_External_Leavers_Ariba controls. As of November 2023, remediation actions were completed in establishing additional monitoring function as part of AS_AMON5.</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2>SAP management also implemented the following controls to address the risks that changers/transfers and terminated users (employee and external workers) may have access beyond their job change date or termination date:</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2>\u00b7 UAM04_Term_Impact - to assess whether any terminated internal employees or external workers had inappropriate access to production post termination.</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2>\u00b7 UAM04_Changers_limpact- to assess whether any internal employee changers had inappropriate access to production post change date.</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2>Management concluded that there is no indication of unauthorized access that affects customer data during the report period of April 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023.</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2>SAP management also implemented UAM04_PIT - which addresses whether all active IDM accounts were appropriate or had any inappropriate events as of July 4, 2023 and September 29, 2023.

        "content": "Always Designing for People\"\nTRANSACTION PROCESSING\nOverview of Key Transaction Processing/Services\nAutoPay Payroll Services transaction processing encompasses three major components: Payroll Input, Payroll Processing, and Payroll Output. Payroll Input consists of payroll data related to an employee's current period hours and/or earnings and Masterfile maintenance that is collected from the client into ADP-provided Input Systems or communicated directly to ADP for input by phone or fax. ADP processes payroll transactions using the client-provided input and generates a variety of standard and optional output reports (e.g., payroll registers, payroll summary), data files (e.g., money movement, direct deposit, general ledger files including files for NAS ADP GL and MAS GLI, iPay, and iReports files). Output reports and files are distributed to clients when produced. The following is a high-level overview of the payroll transaction flow:\n<table><tr><th colSpan=6>AutoPay</th></tr><tr><th colSpan=6></th></tr><tr><th>Clients</th><th colSpan=3>Phone / Fax / Road Payrolls iPay/ PCPW Enterprise HR AutoLink/\nSelf Service Portal 1 Self Service Portal/ PayForce\n:unselected: :unselected: :unselected:</th><th colSpan=2>Marketplace\nConsumed by Vantage, Enterprise, WFN, Lifion Lifion/ Vantage/ WFN\n:unselected: :unselected:</th></tr><tr><td rowSpan=3>AutoPay</td><td></td><td colSpan=2>EPC MQSeries Infolink</td><td colSpan=2 rowSpan=3>PTCS EDIT NET Turbo API</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2>KeyFast MQSeries</td><td>RTP SOAP API\n:selected:</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2 rowSpan=3>Datapool</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowSpan=3></td><td></td><td colSpan=2 rowSpan=2>WRAP</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colSpan=2></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowSpan=2>Client Outputs</td><td colSpan=3>iReports / iPay Paychecks\nfiles</td><td colSpan=2>Vouchers\nMoney General Printed Infolink / Movement Ledger files reports MQSeries files to client</td></tr><tr><td colSpan=3></td><td colSpan=2>NAS ADP GL and MAS GLI files</td></tr></table> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

        "content": "Always Designing for People\"\nPayroll Input\nDatapool\nDatapool, a component of the AutoPay Application, is the central repository for data received from any of the Input Systems. Data is held in Datapool until it is ready for processing. Datapool imports and retains information to be processed by the AutoPay Application until polled by the PTCS. Once polled, the data is submitted to the next processing phase of the AutoPay Application.\nThe AutoPay Application receives client data input from two primary input methods:\n\u00b7 Automated Input (primary method) - Clients can use one of several ADP-supplied Input Systems, such as Enterprise, PayForce, iPay, or Self-Service Portal. Input Systems can be hosted by ADP or installed at a client site (i.e., premised-based systems). Premised-based systems are optional and not in the scope of this Description.\n\u00b7 Manual Input (secondary method - a small percentage of clients) -\no Clients communicate payroll data to ADP over the phone or send completed system-generated standard forms that contain payroll data via fax or courier.\no ADP Data Entry (Teledata) operators manually enter the payroll information into the AutoPay Application for processing.\nAutomated Input\nClients use the Input Systems to enter and transmit their payroll transactions which are then automatically transmitted to ADP's AutoPay Application for processing. This enables clients to enter and validate transactions and provides them with more control over entering payroll information. When clients use the Input Systems, the transactions are transmitted to AutoPay for processing through one of the following communication systems: ADP's EPC or Infolink, or the MQSeries file-transfer system. These communication systems run on ADP's local area network (LAN) and periodically communicate with the Mainframe's Datapool component through automatic interfaces. Built-in security features (e.g., encryption, user IDs, and passwords) enable clients to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive employee information. The Input Systems also promote efficient data entry by using edit checks that are applied when data is input. The edit checks also improve the accuracy of payroll data input before being transmitted to the AutoPay Application for processing.\nEach of the Input Systems allows the client to enter payroll data on an ongoing basis, as information becomes available, enabling data entry flexibility. The data is accumulated within the Input Systems, validated by the client, and held until the client elects to submit it for processing. Upon client submission, the data is automatically transmitted by the communication systems to the AutoPay Application for processing. The data can be recalled by the client from the Input Systems and edited at any time in the Input Systems before\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

The communication systems receive the data throughout the day and periodically transfers it into Datapool where it is held until processed.\nManual Input\nAutoPay Payroll Services clients can also submit payroll transactions directly to ADP Teledata operators by phone. Some regions can receive client payroll information by fax.\nDaily, Teledata operators review online call and fax lists. The call list contains the clients whose payroll input must be obtained that day. A Teledata operator calls the client contact at a pre-arranged time and obtains the payroll information needed for input. In some regions, clients can call the Teledata operators directly. The caller must provide information that identifies them as an authorized Teledata client. The Teledata operator keys the payroll information into the Key-Fast system (a component of the AutoPay Application), which performs a preliminary data verification known as \"editing\" that includes validations against various control databases. Page totals are verified with the client to verify that data is keyed accurately. Input received from Key-Fast is transferred to Datapool where it is held until processed.\nStatutory (STAT) File Maintenance\nThe AutoPay development team currently leverages the Agile methodology to develop and complete AutoPay STAT File Maintenance changes. The specifics of this Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method are described in the following sections.\nThe AutoPay Application tax-withholding rate modules are maintained in the STAT File database. The STAT File database feeds the AutoPay statutory and quarter/year-end modules and is used during payroll processing for tax rate information based on client company code and employee number.\nThe Payroll Statutory Kanban team maintains the STAT File database. Statutory Research Shared Services personnel make ongoing inquiries about, and obtain statutory information concerning, requirements and pending and enacted legislation that can impact the following payroll tax issues, some of which, but not all, are housed in the STAT File database: tax withholding calculations, quarter and year-end forms, fringe benefits, magnetic media/electronic-filing specifications, new-product statutory requirement, wage garnishments, new hire reporting, state unemployment wages, and taxability rules.\nStatutory Research Shared Services monitors statutory changes for payroll-related taxes for both U.S. and Canadian taxing authorities at the following levels: federal, state, local (city) and county, Canadian provinces and territories, and U.S. territories and commonwealths. In conducting statutory research, the Statutory Research Shared Services group uses contacts, and maintains evidence of each contact for tracking purposes, at relevant government agencies, various online and hard-copy publications, relevant Internet websites, Internal Revenue\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

The Statutory Project Manager then creates a \"Development\" tracking item, which is assigned to a Business Analyst on the Payroll Statutory Kanban team. The Business Analyst is responsible for prioritizing, analyzing, and scheduling the statutory item, based upon the effective date of the statutory change. Identifying the AutoPay Application impacts (e.g., STAT File, quarter, client, region), and creating \"Narratives\" to be used for further research and development of the proposed change, is also the responsibility of the business analyst.\nEach narrative has a developer, tester, and documentation specialist assigned. Elaboration sessions are held to review the narrative's content and apply revisions as needed. The assigned business analyst, developer, tester, and documentation specialist participate in elaboration. After elaboration is complete, development occurs, followed by testing and certification. Certification and acceptance of the statutory change by the Payroll Statutory Kanban team tester signifies that the STAT File database updates are ready for deployment. The Payroll Statutory Kanban team's Scrum Master holds daily meetings to discuss the status of each feature and narrative. The status is tracked using tracking software.\nThe Statutory Project Manager holds a weekly tracking meeting to discuss the status of time-sensitive open statutory changes not yet released to the regions. A point-in-time tracking report lists open tracking items, and the WIP report that lists potential, or work-in-progress statutory items monitored by the Statutory Research Shared Services Group, are reviewed during the tracking meeting.\nStatutory changes are implemented based on the details provided in the tracking item and narrative. For changes that do not require code modifications, the STAT File database updates are entered directly in the STAT File database. For changes requiring coding modifications, these follow the standard change management process described in the General Computer Controls section of this Description.\nUpdates requiring coding modifications are coded and tested by either the Payroll Statutory Kanban team or designated AutoPay Scrum teams. Both teams certify and \"accept\" changes signifying they are ready for release to the AutoPay Application production environment. The process and controls for releasing changes follow the Change Management process described in the General Computer Controls section of this Description.\nLogical access to the STAT File database is limited to authorized personnel who log in using their Mainframe user ID and password. The process and controls for STAT File database access follow the Logical Security process described in the General Computer Controls section of this Description.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

        "content": "@\nAlways Designing for People\"\nPayroll Processing\nProcessing is divided into two phases: EDIT and NET/CALC. ADP uses the AutoPay Application's PTCS to track, control, and monitor the results of each processing phase. PTCS controls the processing of data from Datapool through NET/CALC processing. Using online screens, individual Regions can define processing parameters based on their individual requirements, including the length of time data can accumulate before being transferred to the next processing phase. PTCS provides online inquiries to track the status of the individual payrolls that are being processed by the AutoPay Application. PTCS also provides online control totals and daily production statistics that are used to track and monitor AutoPay Application processing activities.\nEDIT Processing\nEDIT is an AutoPay Application program, managed by PTCS, that automatically collects and processes payroll data received from Datapool.\nDuring EDIT processing, the program automatically compares the payroll data received from Datapool with the EMP to verify information such as employee numbers. Four error levels are used to evaluate the comparison: 1) Syntactical; 2) Relational I; 3) Relational II, and 4) Relational III. Syntactical checks verify syntax for propriety. These relational levels provide more detailed edit checking based on error complexity. The rules are stored in the Batch Edit Rule Database and changes follow the ADP change management process. The EDIT program then flags payroll data as Ready for Edit, Ready for NET/CALC, Error, and Ready for Reprocessing. The Editing Group reviews payroll data flagged as 'Error' and if they cannot correct the error, the Client Services Group is notified. The Client Services Group then contacts the client to resolve the error. The Editing Group may contact clients directly to resolve errors.\nOnce EDIT errors are corrected, the program communicates the payroll data status to PTCS as 'Ready for NET/CALC' and the next processing phase, NET/CALC, starts.\nThe EDIT processing phase produces one output from the CUI database file. This file maintains payroll information on a company level and is used to support the NET/CALC process and remains on the AutoPay Application for a defined amount of time as specified by the individual region. The CUI information is retained so the region can rerun a payroll if necessary.\nNET/CALC Processing\nPTCS moves client payrolls flagged as Ready for NET/CALC processing from the CUI database file into NET/CALC. Once moved, the NET/CALC processing phase calculates the current payroll and updates the EMP based on client-defined payroll schedules. Payrolls requiring immediate processing are referred to as \"Hot\" payrolls and can be flagged by ADP's PTCS personnel to prioritize their processing.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

        "content": "@\nAlways Designing for People\"\nThe NET/CALC processing phase uses client options that reside in the CCI database to determine how variable routines such as calculating gross earnings, providing credit for vacation, holiday, and sick time, taking voluntary deductions and other such matters are to be handled. Clients are responsible for providing the data used to configure their options in CCI upon implementation and for communicating updates to those options to ADP in a timely manner.\nIf a client submits changes for company or EMP items, the changes replace the previous EMP entries. The NET/CALC process takes the input data for each employee, refers to the EMP record for items such as the employee's earnings rate, tax status, and authorized deductions, and calculates the gross earnings, voluntary deductions, and net pay. The STAT File houses tax rate and formula information. Using AutoPay's Statutory database (STAT File) NET/CALC calculates taxes and year-to-date balances for gross earnings, federal, state, and local income tax, social security deductions, and goal amounts. The NET/CALC process reformats the AutoPay Application data into a readable format that is ready for additional processing during the WRAP processing phase.\nMonitoring of Processing Activities\nThe GETS Organization and the GETS Command Center staff use automated tools to continuously monitor the status of the scheduled jobs (e.g., transmissions, NET/CALC, and EDIT jobs) and to alert the staff about job failures. This process is covered as part of the ADP GET US Organization SOC 1 Report.\nOutput\nWRAP Processing\nUpon completion of the NET/CALC process, the WRAP process is kicked off to produce multiple outputs. The primary AutoPay Application outputs are categorized into one of the following: Pay Statements, Reports (printed and electronic), and Data Files (e.g., files for other ADP systems, Money Movement/Direct Deposit Files).\nTurbo Output API\nTurbo API (Application Programming Interface) returns detailed results of the payroll to other ADP systems, like Enterprise, Next Gen HCM, Vantage, and Workforce Now. The data consists of payroll summary and employee pay details, including deductions, earnings, taxes as well as regular and year to date accumulators.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

        "content": "Always Designing for People\"\nPay Statements\nAutoPay Application outputs, categorized as pay statements, which are physically printed and distributed to clients are:\n\u00b7 Checks (including ADPChecks): Printed with the net paid amount preceded with asterisks. The earnings statement provides a comprehensive record showing the elements of gross pay (e.g., hours and rate), payroll taxes and deductions, and year-to-date totals. Company check control totals are provided to verify the number of checks issued, the first and last check numbers used, and the total dollar amount of the checks printed.\n\u00b7 Vouchers: Similar to checks in both information content and control procedures. Vouchers are produced for employees who elect direct deposit. \"Non-Negotiable\" and \"This Is Not A Check\" are clearly indicated on the voucher.\n\u00b7 Non-Negotiable Laser Check: A voucher-like notification provided to employers who pay their employees in cash. The document provides the employees with a net-pay amount and a comprehensive earnings statement.\nDesign characteristics in ADP's payroll checks and stubs provide security protection against color copy and scanner duplication systems. The checks include an intricate encoding pattern within high-resolution borders that become distorted when duplicated. Also, the background of the checks uses a multi-tone shade over a cascading building block design (prismatic printing) that is difficult to accurately reproduce, and the shading accentuates the word \"VOID\" when the check is copied. On the reverse side of the check, a unique printing pattern of multi- width lines embedded with encoding marks has been added to protect the document from scanner duplication. In addition, ADP's check design uses several sophisticated features that include:\n\u00b7 Thermochromic ink that provides a heat-sensitive ADP logo and ADP watermark to verify the authenticity\n\u00b7 A unique control number on pre-numbered check stock that uses special ink to improve tracking\nChecks are produced on laser printers with a Graphics Handling Option. If a paper jam occurs during check printing, most printers reject damaged checks and continue to print where the jam occurred, and the printer notes where the error occurred. Operators visually scan the jam point for proper sequencing, possible duplication, or additional damage. Rejected checks are subsequently moved to a holding area. The printer reprints the checks that the operator removed from the jam point. Other printers automatically insert a pink sheet of paper at the point where the paper jam occurred. The operator removes the damaged checks from the printer paper path and the printer automatically reprints the checks that the operator removed and marks the point of duplication with a pink sheet. Some Regions use Quality Assurance (QA) to inspect the laser-printed paper sheets both preceding and following the inserted pink sheet of paper to identify any duplicate checks.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Checks that are not stuffed inside envelopes are wrapped in rubber bands and forwarded to the Processing Support Organization.\nThe envelope-stuffing machines provide a total count of the number of envelopes stuffed and detect checks that are duplicates or out-of-sequence. Each check and voucher page have an encoded page number. Some regions incorporate additional parity checks to verify odd and even sequences. Two sequential odd or even checks indicate a potential error. Operators review identified error messages and resolve identified issues promptly. If checks are damaged during the printing or stuffing process, the operators deface or destroy the checks in a controlled manner. Operators maintain a record of damaged checks that is forwarded to QA and/or banking personnel to alert them of potential duplicate or missing checks.\nQuality Control personnel review payroll reports checks and vouchers for defects as they package them for delivery. Quality Control personnel are restricted from having access to modify the pay statements within the AutoPay Application and Operations Center System. If QA personnel discover a problem with a printed payroll (e.g., wrinkling, tears, or smudges), a rerun, or reprint, may be scheduled.\nReports\nEach region is responsible for setting up and maintaining clients' reporting requirements and schedules.

ADPR can pull data into these reports from multiple products allowing clients to integrate reporting functionality. ADPR houses meta data that the client can select to design the reports and business rules for pulling data from products used by the client including payroll (AutoPay), Benefits (HWSE) or from HCM products such as Workforce Now or Vantage, amongst other options.\nMoney Movement/Direct Deposit Files\nThe AutoPay Application produces money movement and direct deposit files and transmits them for clients that have elected FSDD, or a regular Direct Deposit option as follows:\n\u00b7 Traditional Banking: Offers transmission to financial institutions or bank service processors. Regular direct deposit information is transmitted directly to individual banks via an Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer.\n\u00b7 Money Movement: Offers transmission to ADP's TotalPay service for FSDD and ADPCheck information is transmitted to partner banks. ADPChecks are printed in the regions.\nTransmission to Traditional Banking\nUpon completion of payroll processing, the direct deposit payment information is written to a separate file and stored for transmission to the appropriate recipient for clients who use the regular direct deposit service. Regular direct deposit information is transmitted primarily to banks. For ADP clients that elect regular direct deposit, client management is responsible for completing their agreements and authorizations with their individual banks and providing the required banking information to ADP.\n\u00b7 Setup - The Data Transmission team receives daily reports indicating which payrolls have run and which are awaiting transmission to a specific bank. Banks can receive or retrieve direct deposit files from ADP. The status of bank transmissions is reviewed daily.

The Product Owner is responsible for declaring which items are the most important to the business (Minimum Viable Product - MVP). The Scrum Development Team is responsible for selecting the amount of work to implement without accruing technical debt.\nDaily Scrum and Sprint Execution\nEvery day, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Scrum Development Team members spend a total of 15 to 30 minutes reporting to each other. During each meeting, Scrum Development Team members summarize the previous days' work and the current days' work, as well as what impediments exist. During Sprint execution, the Scrum Development Team defines, develops, and reviews system requirements to produce an MVP. Business User Stories, written by the Product Owner, contain requirements. Scrum Development Team members write technical User Stories, which also support the MVP. The structure for the hardware, software, and data supporting the requirements is determined and developed. The Scrum Development Team plans for system implementation, testing, documentation, and training. The Scrum Development Team designs, codes, tests, and documents programs and conversion programs. The team uses automated, repeatable tests to help ensure code integrity throughout the sprint iterations. The ChangeMan Version Control System is used to control and monitor source code. The Scrum Development Team maintains current Sprint metrics. Organizational impediments are impediments that are issues beyond the Scrum Development Team's control. ADP Management resolves organizational impediments at the appropriate management level.\nSprint Review Meeting\nAt the end of the sprint, the Scrum Development Team holds a review meeting to demonstrate a working product increment to the product owner and stakeholders. The meeting features a live demonstration. It is the opportunity to inspect and adapt the product as it emerges, and iteratively refine the understanding of the requirements.\nSprint Retrospective Meeting\nAfter a Sprint ends, the Scrum Development Team attends a retrospective meeting to reflect on its own process. They inspect their behavior and take action to adapt it for future Sprints. The goal is to gain a common understanding of multiple perspectives and to develop actions that will take the team and the organization to maturity.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

It is not feasible for control objectives relating to transaction processing to be achieved completely by ADP's management or the user entities acting alone. It is necessary for user entities to implement controls to achieve some of the control objectives identified in this report (as applicable).\nThe User Entity Control Considerations presented below are controls that user entities should have placed in operation to achieve the control objectives in this report and should not be regarded as a comprehensive list of controls that should be used by user entities. The applicability and implementation of these controls may vary by user entity based on the nature of the services and applications being used by ADP's user entities. Other controls may be required by user entities and should therefore be evaluated by the user entity. User entity auditors should consider whether user entities have implemented these controls (as applicable) when understanding and evaluating the internal controls at the respective user entity.\nControl Objective #1: Payroll Data Input\nClient management is responsible for:\n\u00b7 Notifying ADP of changes in the authorized contacts list\n\u00b7 Validating the accuracy of data entry when using the Input Systems\n\u00b7 Reviewing error messages that result from transmitting data, addressing errors, and if necessary, resending data in a timely manner\n\u00b7 The accuracy/completeness and authorization of worksheets and faxes that are sent to ADP\n\u00b7 Setting up a second authentication method (such as the use of a passphrase) for phone or fax payrolls\n\u00b7 Setting up a receipt confirmation method (such as callback or fax) for phone or fax payrolls\n\u00b7 Reviewing correction notices received from ADP\n\u00b7 Reviewing the Master Control report, containing the listing of each employee's master record, produced by the AutoPay Application after initial account set-up, to confirm that employee-level and company- level information was initially recorded completely and accurately\nControl Objective #2: Deductions and Tax Withholding Specifications\nClient management is responsible for:\n\u00b7 The completeness and accuracy of client-specified deductions\n\u00b7 Submitting client-specified deduction changes to ADP in a timely manner\n\u00b7 Verifying the intended payroll transactions were accurately reflected before providing payroll processing approval\n\u00b7 Reviewing the employee changes and any errors presented during payroll preview to determine if any corrections are needed\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

This includes IPE produced by ADP and provided to user entities (if relevant and defined as part of the output control objectives), IPE used by ADP management in the performance of controls (i.e., periodic review of user listings), and IPE used in the performance of our examination procedures.\nBased on the nature of the IPE, a combination of the following procedures was performed to address the completeness and accuracy of the data or reports used: (1) inspect source documentation relating to the IPE, (2) inspect the query, script, or parameters used to generate the IPE, (3) agree data between the IPE and the source, and/or (4) inspect the IPE for anomalous gaps in sequence or timing.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Upon identification, Management performed a root cause analysis and determined that for situations where a user account existed in SMS that did not exist in ADAPT, they would not be identified by the automated termination script. Management performed an analysis of 100% of the accounts with the profile allowing access to the Input Systems potentially impacted and identified one (1) terminated user account. Management obtained the activity log and determined that the account was not used after the termination date. Additionally, Management has identified a complementary user entity control where user entities can review the audit log report to identify any suspicious activity; control 7.05 tests the completeness of this report, without exception.\nAdditional Procedures Performed by Ernst & Young:\nControl 7.04 - EY obtained and inspected Management's analysis of 100% of the accounts potentially impacted by the gap in the design of the automated script. EY reperformed the analysis performed by Management which resulted in the same conclusion and confirmed the account was not utilized after termination date. EY also inspected the updated user listing to confirm the account was removed. Additionally, EY tested a compensating control (Control 7.05) identified by management and noted no deviations.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

It's ADP's priority to identify technology, environmental, process and health risks, and to mitigate the impact of business interruption resulting from a variety of potential events, including the loss of key facilities and resources. A Global Business Resiliency Policy and Program has been developed, in compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines, to establish a single global framework for how ADP manages, and controls identified risks resulting from disasters and other significant business disruptive events. ADP has created an integrated framework that lays out mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery processes.\nDisaster Recovery Planning\nDisaster Recovery plans are developed to recover and/or restore critical systems. Redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. Recovery times vary according to the criticality of the impacted system.\nThe Disaster Recovery plans are developed to:\n\u00b7 Provide an organized and consolidated approach to managing response and recovery activities following an unplanned incident or business interruption, to avoid confusion and to reduce exposure to error\n\u00b7 Provide prompt and appropriate response to any unplanned incident, thereby reducing the impacts resulting from service interruptions\n\u00b7 Recover essential Data Center operations in a timely manner, increasing ADP's ability to recover from a loss to a Data Center or Command Center\nThe Disaster Recovery plans are designed to create a state of readiness that will provide response to any of the following incident scenarios at ADP Data Centers:\n\u00b7 Incidents causing physical damage such as fire, smoke, or water\n\u00b7 Incidents that indirectly affect Data Center facility access such as closure due to a storm, an emergency building evacuation due to a threat, or an external threat such as a fire to a nearby facility\n\u00b7 Impending or unexpected regional disasters such as an earthquake, hurricane, typhoon, or flood\n\u00b7 External incidents, which potentially could cause a service interruption, such as loss of electrical or telecommunication services\nThe Disaster Recovery plans are reviewed, revised, and tested annually. Various components may be subject to semi-annual or quarterly reviews and revisions.\nThis report is intended solely for use by the management of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its clients, and the independent auditors of its clients, and is not intended and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

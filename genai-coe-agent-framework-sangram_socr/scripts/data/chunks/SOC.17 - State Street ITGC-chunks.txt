The Control Objectives and controls included in the Description are those that management of State Street believes are likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting, and the Description does not include those aspects of the System that are not likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Description indicates that certain Control Objectives can be achieved only if complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of State Street's controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with related controls at the service organization. Our examination did not extend to such complementary user entity controls, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary user entity controls.\nState Street uses various subservice organizations, as described in Section III A6 Subservice Organizations to provide certain application development, change management, hosting and data center services.

Our examination was also performed in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, based on the criteria in management's Assertion, the Description is fairly presented and the controls were suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related Control Objectives throughout the period October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAn examination of a description of a service organization's system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls involves:\n. Performing procedures to obtain evidence about the fairness of the presentation of the Description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related Control Objectives, based on the criteria in the Assertion.\n.

State Street is also committed to complying with all sanctions that are legally binding on it and its business across all of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nState Street has appointed a Global Head of Financial Crimes Compliance Officer who leads a team of employees with experience in this area to oversee State Street's Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions compliance program (the \"Global AML and Sanctions Program\" or the \"Global Program\"). State Street's Global AML and Sanctions Program is comprised of written anti-money laundering and sanctions policies, standards, procedures, internal controls and systems, which include but are not limited to the following: a customer identification program and procedures; procedures to collect and update, as appropriate, customer due diligence information; screening of customer and transactions against sanctions and other watch lists; processes to assess money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks at the program, customer and product levels; processes and systems to monitor customer transactions and activity; processes and systems to identify and report suspicious activity; training of employees on AML and sanctions requirements; processes to retain required records; and regular independent testing conducted by Corporate Audit.\nThe Global AML and Sanctions Program is periodically evaluated, updated and enhanced in order to reflect changes to State Street business activities, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable supervisory standards and legal requirements. The global program is approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. State Street cooperates fully with law enforcement and regulatory investigations and inquiries.\nAlso included as part of State Street's Financial Crimes Compliance (\"FCC\") Program is the oversight of anti-bribery and corruption and fraud.

The Material Risk Identification (\"MRI\") Process is one of State Street's primary risk identification programs and utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify State Street's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off- balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational/technology, fiduciary, business, reputational, and regulatory risks. The primary output from the program is a firm-wide Material Risk Inventory, which is a comprehensive list of the risks that could significantly impact State Street, irrespective of their likelihood or frequency.

In addition, the quarterly MRI updates focus on identifying emerging risks and triggering events that could cause State Street's exposures to materialize. The Material Risk Inventory forms a holistic view of the firm's risk profile and is used as a foundational element in State Street's risk management and capital planning processes. ERM, and State Street's control functions more broadly, are responsible for providing review and challenge during the risk identification process to ensure that they are effectively capturing all key risks to which the business is exposed.\nMonitoring\nState Street management is responsible for continuously monitoring risk exposure across the company and assessing the design and operating effectiveness of its controls. The monitoring process is accomplished through a variety of ongoing activities, including risk monitoring activities performed by the First and Second Lines of Defense (described in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure), operational event reporting, credit exposure reporting, key risk and performance indicator reporting, and consolidated risk reporting to senior management, oversight committees and the Board of Directors. Management also reviews the results of separate evaluations performed by regulators and Corporate Audit and takes appropriate action to remediate any identified issues. State Street's Board of Directors and senior management provide overall oversight and management review of operating performance. Risk management is a shared responsibility between the business units and ERM. State Street employs a three lines of defense model in which risk management is a shared responsibility between all lines\nof defense. Refer to the description of the three lines of defense in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Enterprise Risk Management for further details on State Street's approach to risk management and the related responsibilities.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nState Street leverages and relies on third-party providers for products and services to support its operations, services and initiatives. \"Third-Party Provider\" is broadly defined as any entity that has entered into a contractual relationship with State Street to support its business functions and activities. While using third-party services assists in obtaining necessary expertise, expanding product offerings, improving services and managing cost, it also introduces potential risks inherent with involvement of a third-party provider. Such risks need to be assessed prior to engaging with the third party and requires ongoing monitoring and management throughout the lifecycle of a third-party engagement. As a result, State Street has implemented a Third-Party Risk Management (\"TPRM\") program for assessing and managing risks associated with the use of third-party products and services throughout the engagement lifecycle in a manner consistent with compliance and regulatory requirements.\nTPRM is managed within a governance structure that includes oversight from State Street's Board of Directors including the Technology and Operations Risk Committee, the Third Party and Outsourcing Risk Committee, and the three lines of defense as detailed in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Enterprise Risk Management.

The IRQ measures the level of inherent risk within a State Street function that is looking to leverage the products or services of a third party to support its business activities. Both the inherent risk rating for the product or service as well as the required due diligence to be performed on the proposed third party are driven by the level of inherent risk determined through the IRQ. The due diligence process includes a series of control review programs that are completed by the third party to provide visibility on the design of the third party's controls prior to contracting. The program has defined an ongoing monitoring program. The level of inherent risk determines the timeframe for re-assessment, including annual review and update of the IRQ, or whenever there are significant changes to the scope of products or services. Scheduled updates to control reviews with the third party occur on a frequency based on the level of inherent risk.\n3. State Street Governance and Structure\nState Street's approach to risk management involves all levels of management, from the Board of Directors and its committees, including the Risk Committee, the Examining and Audit Committee, the Human Resources Committee, and the Technology and Operations Committee, to each business unit and each employee. Responsibility for risk oversight is allocated so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. Risk management is the responsibility of each employee and is implemented through a three lines of defense framework.\nThe First Line of Defense. The business and functional units who perform day-to-day operational and/or support activities that may give rise to risk operate as the First Line of Defense (\"FLOD\"). The FLOD owns the risks associated with their activities and is responsible for establishing effective internal controls to manage such risks to an acceptable level and promoting a strong culture of risk awareness.\nThe Second Line of Defense. Control functions independent of the FLOD, such as Enterprise Risk Management and Corporate Compliance, operate as the Second Line of Defense (\"SLOD\"). The SLOD is responsible for setting the corporate risk appetite limits, developing policies and procedures to evaluate whether risks remain within the appropriate limits, monitoring risk-taking, and providing credible review and challenge to the FLOD risk management practices. Refer to additional details in Enterprise Risk Management and Corporate Compliance sections below.\nThe Third Line of Defense. Corporate Audit operates as the independent Third Line of Defense (\"TLOD\"). The TLOD is responsible for assessing the effectiveness of the First and Second Lines of Defense as it relates to managing risk and providing reporting to the Board of Directors and management. Refer to additional details in the Corporate Audit section below.\nEnterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\")\nThe Chief Risk Officer leads ERM globally and has a dual reporting line directly to State Street's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

To support this Risk Appetite Framework, ERM has implemented a comprehensive governance structure that provides focused oversight of material risks, establishes corporate risk guidelines and provides a formal mechanism to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of risk. In fulfilling its monitoring and oversight responsibilities, ERM is responsible for proactively monitoring firm-wide risk-taking and has established regular processes for reporting on top risk exposures and emerging risk issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. In addition, ERM is responsible for developing, or ensuring the integrity of, the risk measurement methodologies and tools that are used to monitor the Firm's risk profile relative to its risk appetite. In situations where a material exposure is at-risk of breaching the Firm's risk appetite, ERM is charged with taking the actions it deems appropriate to mitigate or reduce the potential impact to the Firm's earnings, capital or reputation. In the event of a risk appetite breach, ERM has established a formal escalation process to promptly inform the Management Risk and Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of any risk issues that could materially impact the Firm.\nERM manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure, which includes:\n(1) Dedicated \"Vertical\" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;\n[2] \"Horizontal\" risk groups that monitor risks that cross all of State Street's business units, such as operational risk and credit risk, or that develop, maintain, and assess the effectiveness of the infrastructure that is used to support all of ERM's activities, such as Centralized Modeling and Analytics; and\n(3) Risk oversight of international activities, which combines intersecting \"verticals\" and \"horizontals\" through a hub-and-spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework.\nSitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is the Risk Superstructure, which is responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level Risk Appetite Framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across State Street. At its foundation is the Recovery and Resolution Planning function, responsible for developing and maintaining the firm-wide strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of State Street, the Centralized Modeling and Analytics function, which provides modeling and analytical support for ERM and Global Treasury, and Corporate Compliance, which establishes the firm-wide approach to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk globally.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n9",

Corporate Compliance is responsible for overseeing the management of core compliance risk, which are those instances where the primary risk exposure is the failure to comply with regulatory obligations, through the administration of the Core Compliance Oversight Program (\"CCOP\"). Corporate Compliance is also responsible for ensuring policies to address the management of material core compliance risks are developed and communicated, as necessary. Embedded compliance risk, defined as instances where compliance with regulatory obligations is a component of another risk exposure but not the prevailing risk (e.g., credit risk, technology risk), is managed through specialized risk management programs administered by Enterprise Risk Management.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is responsible for overseeing the design, development and implementation of the CCOP globally. The Chief Compliance Officer meets regularly with the Examining & Audit Committee (\"E&A Committee\") to discuss the effectiveness of the CCOP and has the authority to communicate directly with the E&A Committee on any issues relevant to the CCOP. Annually, the Chief Compliance Officer liaises with the Senior Risk Officers responsible for overseeing areas of embedded compliance risk to compile and report an opinion of compliance risk management practices for each area of embedded compliance risk to the E&A Committee.\nState Street also has a Standard of Conduct that describes the principles of business conduct expected of all employees of State Street and its subsidiaries globally.\nThe Standard of Conduct addresses a variety of business and personal conduct matters and sets forth the acceptable conduct required of all employees.

ITGC Overview\nInformation Technology\nState Street's approach to IT has developed from a singular focus on meeting the needs of global institutional investors. Creating operational scale and efficiency is critical to State Street's ability to deliver value for clients, and as such, State Street has closely aligned its IT strategy with its business model. Members of IT leadership are embedded within the business lines, helping prioritize project development, to help ensure business goals are met and leveraging synergies wherever possible.\nState Street uses third-party providers for the operation of various ITGC processes and execution of certain tasks related to infrastructure support services over: change management, job scheduling and incident management, and backup and recovery processes and controls. State Street uses these third-party providers as a vendor staff augmentation model under State Street's direction and within State Street's Information Security Environment to perform certain tasks which are relevant to the criteria and specified controls. State Street has monitoring and oversight mechanism and controls in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the tasks executed by these third-party providers to confirm they are performed accurately, completely, and timely. Such control activities include periodic status meetings and processing reports that monitor the tasks performed by the providers.\nState Street's IT division, led by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\"), identifies, establishes and communicates the IT strategic vision and direction globally as well as oversees enterprise technology infrastructure, application development and maintenance, systems architecture and information security.\nThe Office of the CIO is supported by the following groups and functions:\n.

Complementary User Entity Controls\nState Street's controls represent only a portion of the overall internal control environment of each client. Clients also need to implement and maintain effective internal control. Each client's internal control depends upon the nature of the transactions processed, the degree of interaction of controls and the terms of agreement with State Street. This section highlights those controls that State Street believes should be present for each State Street client (\"Complementary User Entity Control\"). State Street has considered Complementary User Entity Controls in developing the controls that are described in Section IV A of this report.\nThis report should be used in conjunction with the applicable complementary State Street business control reports. Those reports may also include complementary user entity controls necessary to achieve certain control objectives identified in the complementary State Street business control reports.

Changes in State Street Operations\nIdentity and Access Management Program\nThis multi-year program consists of two workstreams: Identity and Access Management (\"IAM\") and Privileged Access Management (\"PAM\"). The objective of the IAM workstream is to apply a set of consistent identity and access controls to applications based on a tiered approach. The objective of the PAM workstream is to develop and apply a set of consistent controls across the enterprise, enabled via a centralized privileged access management solution.\nThe IAM program is implementing centralized platform capabilities for requesting and approving access to systems, role management, rules and separation of duties policy enforcement, recertifications, and discovery through a single pane of glass view of user access privileges. Please refer to the Application Listing in Section III B, which identifies the Security Administration and Access Recertification process for each in-scope application.\nAs part of the program, for certain applications, access administration functions for employees and contingent workers are administered through SailPoint, a self-service tool for identity storage, access requests and entitlement provisioning. SailPoint is used to provision and recertify access to the applications as documented in Section II B Application Listing and applications continue to be on-boarded onto SailPoint in a phased approach.\nB.

Contingent workers include temporary employees, contractors and vendors. Requests for additional access to State Street facilities, excluding data centers and computer rooms, must be approved by designated State Street personnel. Requests for access to data centers and computer rooms must be submitted to designated State Street IT personnel. Designated State Street IT personnel are authorized to approve access requests to data centers and computer rooms based on the business need for the access requested. Global Security will process approved access requests. Permanent employees and contingent workers are assigned a unique access card to gain entry to State Street facilities. Global Security uses physical security management tools to assign and manage access card information, including the access card ID number, the individual's GHR ID, hire date, access card expiration date and facilities access privileges. Physical security management tools are also used for alarm monitoring, recording digital video, photo ID badging and visitor management. Update access to physical security management tools is restricted to designated Global Security personnel, based on job responsibilities.\nPermanent employees and contingent workers who have lost or damaged their access card are responsible for timely notifying Global Security personnel to disable the access card and to have a new access card issued.\nAccess Revocation\nDesignated State Street personnel communicate terminations for permanent employees and contingent workers to GHR and Global Procurement Services, respectively. GHR, Global Procurement Services and/or hiring managers are primarily responsible for updating the employment status in the Human Resources Management System (\"HRMS\") application or Contingent Labors application, for contingent workers with the last date worked. Designated State Street personnel may update the HRMS application directly.\nGlobal Security personnel are notified of permanent employees' and contingent workers' termination status in a timely manner. The HRMS application sends a file to the physical security management tool, used to assign and manage access card information to data centers, co-located data centers and computer rooms globally. Through automated job schedules (North America and Asia Pacific) or through an automated workflow process by which Global Security personnel receive and upload the file to the physical security management tool (Europe), the HRMS file automatically updates the terminated permanent employee's or contingent worker's expiration date in the access card record with the termination date or agency end date from the HRMS file. This file is sent twice daily, except for weekends. The logic used to produce the HRMS file includes the earliest of the\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION\n27",

The file automatically updates the terminated permanent employee's or contingent worker's expiration date in the access card record with the earliest of the termination date or last date worked from the HRMS file. Global Security personnel have the ability to manually block the access card of permanent employees and contingent workers who require immediate termination. Upon termination, a permanent employee's or contingent worker's access card is automatically disabled based on the expiration date in the access card record.\nPhysical Access Recertification Activities\nAccess to data centers and computer rooms is restricted to designated State Street employees and contingent workers. On an annual basis, designated State Street IT personnel review the access to determine whether existing access remains appropriate based on job responsibility. In addition, periodic review of existing access is performed by IT personnel responsible for the data centers and computer rooms. Modifications to data center and computer room access privileges are communicated to Global Security personnel for processing.\nFacility Access Controls\nValid access cards are required to enter State Street facilities. In addition to the facilities' access card, authentication through keypad readers and/or biometric devices may be required to gain access to the data centers and computer rooms.\nPhysical security management tools record access to data centers and computer room entry. Video cameras record access to data center entry and/or exit points. Global Security personnel monitor and respond to unauthorized activity at State Street data centers and computer rooms.\nVisitors, including State Street permanent employees, contingent workers or non-affiliated third parties, requiring access to data centers or computer rooms must be pre-registered by authorized State Street personnel. A visitor must show identification before being granted access to the data center or computer room and is required to sign in and out at the lobby security desk. Visitor activity is monitored by designated State Street personnel while on the premises.\nLogical Access\nProcedures, including the State Street Global Cybersecurity (\"GCS\") Standards and the Identity and Access Management Policy and Standards, related to user administration are in place to guide Global Technology Services personnel in the process of adding, modifying or deleting users to/from the local network, databases and environments.

        "content": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GENERAL CONTROLS\nPolicy, Standards and Procedures\nState Street has a Global Cybersecurity Policy, which is approved annually by the Technology and Operational Risk Committee of the board. State Street's GCS group has developed and implemented written information security standards to guide State Street personnel through the process of managing and monitoring access to production applications, databases and operating systems, and the corporate network for State Street permanent employees and contingent workers.\nState Street also has a comprehensive GCS Program to protect the information and data owned and used by State Street, its subsidiaries and affiliates, permanent employees, contingent workers, business partners, clients and other third-party relationships. Contingent workers include temporary employees, contractors and vendors. State Street has aligned these controls to the NIST 800 53R4 special publication and is in the process of aligning to the NIST 800 53R5 revision.\nTo help achieve the GCS Program objectives, State Street has established a global ISO network. The ISO network creates a strong relationship between GCS and State Street business units and works to consistently integrate the information security controls into State Street's business processes.\nUser ID and Password Management\nState Street permanent employees and contingent workers are required to access State Street's corporate network prior to authenticating at the application, database, and/or operating system-level through the use of a valid Local Area Network (\"LAN\") user ID and password combination. Application-level authentication may occur through the LAN user ID or may require a separate application, database, and/or operating system user ID and password combination. When accessing the network remotely, users are required to use multi-factor authentication.\nAuthentication standards have been established by the GCS group and include single factor using a password or multi-factor leveraging a Secure ID Token with a password and/or PIN. Password and PIN standards have been established by the GCS group and require production applications, databases, and operating systems be configured by designated personnel (where technically feasible) to adhere to minimum requirements. A process exists for management to review password settings for production applications, databases and operating systems that do not comply with GCS standards and evaluate the potential risks and mitigating controls associated with the current password settings.\nSecurity settings for operating systems have been configured, including LAN authentication, for a limited number of invalid access attempts before the account is locked. A time delay is in place for disabled LAN user IDs before the user ID owner can re-authenticate to the system. A State Street permanent employee or contingent worker who has locked their account is required to either contact the Help Desk or access an on-line self-service tool and provide at least two forms of identification to unlock their account.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n29",

For certain applications, multiple levels of authentication may be required and the provisioning of each level of authentication may be managed by different groups. Please refer to Section III B Application Listing, which identifies the Security Administration process for each of the in-scope applications, which are further described below:\n\u00b7 SailPoint: A self-service tool for identity storage, access requests and entitlement provisioning. For access managed in SailPoint, access requests are managed through designated approval processes, with restricted access approved by designated authorized approvers.\n\u00b7 Security Administration Services (\"SAS\"): Responsible for access administration for certain core applications. For access not administered by SailPoint, access requests are submitted using a web-based access request tool that automates the initiation, approval routing, and business unit notification of user access requests or via email.\n. International Security Administration Services (\"ISAS\"): Responsible for regional centralized access administration for applications within the EMEA and APAC regions. For access not administered by SailPoint, access requests are submitted and actioned via a web-based ticketing tool or via email.\n\u00b7 SSGA Security Administration (\"SSGA IT\"): Responsible for access administration for SSGA IT applications. User Provisioning System (\"UPS\"), a role-based access system, is also used to support access recertifications for SSGA applications and environments on a periodic basis and at least once every calendar year.\n\u00b7 AIS IT: A dedicated group within TPEO is responsible for access administration for applications supporting the Alternatives sector.\n\u00b7 Application Specific Security Administration: Based on business requirements, designated support teams perform Security Administration for certain business aligned applications. The people, process or technology used to manage the security administration process is unique to each application.\n\u00b7 Enterprise Security Framework (\"eSF\"): For certain applications, including those residing in the Private Cloud, access administration functions for employees and contingent workers are administered through eSF, a self- service tool for access requests and entitlement provisioning.\nAdditional information about the access administration process for State Street permanent employees and contingent workers globally is described in further detail below:\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 30",

New access requests are managed through designated approval processes, with restricted access approved by designated authorized approvers. Initial access to the State Street corporate network (i.e., Active Directory LAN) is provisioned to new employees and contingent workers automatically through the SailPoint birthright provisioning automated process (aka Joiner). Managers initiate access requests through SailPoint self-service or using Business as Usual (\"BAU\") processes for entitlement access not supported by SailPoint. Privileged access follows the standard IAM controls but would have an additional level of approval to ensure access is appropriate and is restricted to technology operational roles. Where technically feasible, certain privileged access activity is logged and certain high risk events are monitored within the SIEM tool (see Security Monitoring section below).\nDesignated State Street personnel communicate transfers and terminations for permanent employees and contingent workers to GHR and Global Procurement Services, respectively. GHR and Global Procurement Services are primarily responsible for updating the work location and/or department in the HRMS application. However, designated State Street personnel may also have the ability to update the HRMS application directly. Designated State Street personnel may also submit an access modification request to State Street Security Administration personnel as a result of a change in a permanent employee's or contingent worker's job responsibilities, a recertification or as the result of a transfer. Upon daily notification of movers from the HRMS application, for certain applications on SailPoint, the user's access is automatically taken \"back to birthright\" or a notification is sent to the employee and their manager to review the access remains appropriate based on the employee's current job responsibilities. Please refer to the relevant SailPoint footnote within Section III B Application Listing for details.\nFor access administered outside of SailPoint, access authorization and modification requests may be submitted to SAS, ISAS or dedicated State Street Security Administration groups through email or through the access request tools. For access requests submitted through access request tools, these tools have been configured to help enforce segregation of duties between access requestors and access approvers. For access requests submitted to the Help Desk or dedicated State Street Security Administration groups through email, Security Administration personnel manually review the access request for completeness and determine whether approvals are appropriate by cross-referencing the listing of authorized approvers or validating that the individual approving the access request is the permanent employee's or contingent worker's hiring manager, supervisor or higher level individual within the same business unit. In addition, State Street Security Administration personnel also manually check that the access approver is not the same individual for whom the access is being requested.\nAccess is granted by State Street Security Administration personnel according to the access privileges specified in the access request. State Street Security Administration personnel responsible for processing an access request are not involved in the approval of that same access request.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 31",

GHR and Global Procurement Services are primarily responsible for updating the employment status in the HRMS application for employees or in the Contingent Labors application for contingent workers with the last date worked and termination date. The Contingent Labors application sends an automated feed to the HRMS application daily, except for Saturday and Sunday. Designated State Street personnel may also have the ability to update the HRMS application directly.\nFor employees and contingent workers whose termination request was entered more than five business days post-termination date, GHR and Contingent Labor Support, respectively, perform a monthly review of logical and physical access to determine whether access was used for the period between the termination date and when the termination request was entered into the HRMS application. Access usage, if any, is documented and analyzed for potential impact and tracked to resolution.\nDaily, an automated feed containing terminated permanent employee or contingent worker status from the HRMS application is sent to security administration tools for access revocation.\nFor access managed by SailPoint, the leaver process initiates removal of a user's access for users identified by GHR as terminated. For conforming applications (communicate via connector), access is automatically removed by SailPoint. For non-conforming applications, SailPoint initiates a work item to security administrators who manually remove the access.

Access recertifications for production applications are executed in various ways based on the application as noted in Section III B Application Listing.\nSailPoint\nThe IAM Centralized Certification team uses an automated recertification tool to perform access recertifications for certain applications and infrastructure and business privileged applications including database and operating system levels as well as access approval authority and change approvers, on a periodic basis and at least once every calendar year. Recertifications are performed for database and operating system administrator IDs as part of the infrastructure and privileged access review. Recertifications for application level administrator IDs are performed as part of the general access recertification through SailPoint or through the infrastructure and privileged access review.\nThe list of users and respective entitlements are programmatically or manually delivered to a secure location for collection into the recertification tool. A comparison check is performed to evaluate the data from the source file against the data pulled into the automated recertification results. This comparison check confirms the completeness of the data collection for the recertification. For any user IDs that cannot be matched to the hierarchical manager based on the HRMS record, the IAM Centralized Certification team is responsible for researching and re-assigning the entitlements to a new manager.\nAfter activation of the review, the recertification tool sends an email notification to each user's hierarchical manager based on the HRMS record. The hierarchical manager is required to log in to the tool and select the appropriate access recertification decision. For infrastructure and business privileged applications reviews, the hierarchical manager's business unit senior manager or above is required to sign off on each manager's recertification decision.\nUpon completion of the automated access recertification, items not reviewed are marked for revocation and the review is closed online.

The SDLC methodology consists of two frameworks: Waterfall (DPF, SRF, SF (in support of SSGA]] and Agile (SCRUM, Kanban, Scale). The Framework defines the core quality standards underlying the development process and provides a flexible yet disciplined methodology, consistency, a common language and defined accountabilities. Each framework has approaches that refer to process models for system development (e.g., DPF, SRF, SF, iA SCRUM, iA Kanban, iA Scale). Techniques are the methods used to accomplish an activity and/or produce deliverables. Tools facilitate the management of the development process and the completion of deliverables. Project documentation is developed in accordance with written SDLC policies and procedures for application development projects.\nTechnology development and acquisition projects follow one of the following SDLC frameworks:\n\u00b7 Industrialized Agile Software Development (\"Agile\"): Agile is an interactive development process based on the principles of collaboration, adaptability and continuous improvements. Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams, including users, promoting iterative, rapid and flexible response to change and consisting of the following approaches:\n- SCRUM: SCRUM is an incremental, iterative approach that brings customer and the implementation team together to deliver valuable business outcomes based on a customer feedback.\n- Kanban: Kanban is an incremental approach that optimizes flow of value to deliver results consistently.\n- Scale: Scale uses SCRUM in its foundation with the ability to align multiple component and/or feature-based teams.\n\u00b7 Waterfall: A linear approach to software development, including the following:\n- Development Process Framework (\"DPF\"): DPF is the methodology used for developing large-scale technology projects and consist of Ideation (includes funding approval), Analysis (details documentation of business requirements), Design (detail documentation of technical design and requirements), Development (code development), Test (code testing), and Deployment (code deployment to production) phases. These phases are managed using detailed project plans and milestones. Each phase consists of milestones delivery and proper documentation capture and approval.\n- Small Request Framework (\"SRF\"): SRF has been created as an abbreviated lifecycle methodology, based on the DPF, to specifically address small request and enhancement projects.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 39 :unselected: :unselected: :unselected:",

Emergency change approvals can be documented in the ServiceNow Change Request subsequent to the emergency change implementation.\nApplication, Database, and Operating System Changes - Testing and Approval\nProduction application, database, or operating system changes may be requested by State Street personnel, which may include business users, production support, or the BCIO group. Changes for databases and operating systems may also be requested by System Administrators. The BCIO group includes project managers, business analysts, application support personnel and application developers. For situations where State Street does not own the source code, vendors may also provide State Street with a new application release or upgrade or develop changes based on State Street business requirements.\nTesting is required in a User Acceptance Testing (\"UAT\") environment for functional changes prior to change implementation, defined as changes (including vendor provided patches) that affect the business logic or usability features of the application. Changes are tested where technically feasible and testing is reviewed prior to approval. Testing for functional changes is performed by designated State Street personnel, which may include business users and/or SQA or an automated tool. Technical changes, including performance improvements, configurations, sizing and job script changes that do not affect the business logic, are reviewed and tested, where technically feasible, by State Street personnel, which may include business users and/or SQA. Defect identification and tracking is also conducted during the testing process for both functional and technical changes.\nExcept Colline, all application, database, and operating system changes require ServiceNow tickets and documentation. The following processes require additional approvals:\n\u00b7 For Business Objects, Cash Management Instruction, FundSuite SX, and Great Plains applications, changes are requested and approved through designated ticketing tools or email.\n. For the Colline application, changes are requested, tested, and approved by State Street through the application service provider's ticketing tool.\nApplication, Database, and Operating System Change Implementation\nIT personnel responsible for change implementation activities check that necessary change approvals are obtained and documented in the change management package, ticket, or tool prior to implementing application changes, database and operating system changes to the production environment. Change management tools may be used to obtain and document approvals from designated State Street personnel. Changes may be implemented to the production environment by the applicable library management tool or State Street IT personnel using designated access or Firecall IDs. Change implementation may also be performed through an automated tool by designated IT personnel. Application, database, and operating system changes should not be implemented by IT personnel to the production environment if approvals or required testing are missing or are not from designated IT personnel authorized to approve the change.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION I\n41",

Refer to the Access Recertification Activities section above for further details on the SailPoint recertification process. Application-change management processes for the Colline application have a small number of change approvers and no periodic review is required.\nSegregation of Duties\nSeparate UAT and production environments exist to segregate application testing and change implementation activities.\nState Street IT personnel with the responsibility to develop application changes are segregated from State Street IT personnel with change implementation responsibilities. Access privileges for application development and change implementation activities are enforced through library management tools, file system security permissions, Systems Administrator level access or through eSF access entitlement tools.\nLibrary management tools may also be used to manage versions of the application source code and/or restrict access to executable code libraries, which are used to move compiled executable code changes from UAT to production. Library management tools time-and-date stamp the application source code, to provide an audit trail of changes performed by State Street IT personnel.\nDevelopment of Macros\nMacros may be used by State Street users to facilitate certain data analysis activities. Users can submit a new macro or modification request to Global Macro Automation Services (\"GMAS\"] through its website.\nA standard request form on the GMAS website is completed by the requestor to initiate a new macro or modification request. Once the request form has been completed, a Developer creates the macro for a new request or makes the enhancements for a modification. The Developer then uses the Multi Document Interface (\"MDI\") Validation tool to validate the macro adheres to the outlined GCS standards, lock down the macro code and any cells with formulas and add the versions control. The Developer then uploads the MDI validated macro and the MDI encrypted file to the GMAS website for Business Team approval. Macros identified by the MDI Validation tool that need additional code review will go through a Code Review Process before being moved to the Business Team approval stage. Macros that do not require any additional code review will move to the Business Team approval stage. The Business Team Owners assign a tester that can approve or reject the macro. After all Business Teams approve the macro, the macro moves into production and is available on the GMAS production website.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n42",

Outstanding incidents remain on the report until resolved.\n. Daily IT Operations Risk Review - Daily meeting to review the incidents from the Daily IT Operations Risk Review report and a summary of major incidents impacting service levels and the business are being communicated to State Street Executive Management.\n\u00b7 Problem Initiation Review - Daily meeting to review major incidents with IT personnel to begin Root Cause Analysis.\nProblem Management\nMonitoring software is used by the GTS Network Architecture group to identify system interruptions and to classify each interruption according to a specified level of severity. The monitoring software automatically sends out an alert to management when predefined thresholds are reached. Processing issues and errors are logged into the CRM tool to facilitate the identification/avoidance of recurring issues, allowing tracking and research of problems to resolution. Escalation and crisis management procedures are documented to provide guidance to system administrators for the communication of production processing issues to the appropriate individuals.\nThe Incident Management policies and procedures are reviewed annually to confirm accuracy. The IT Service/ Help Desk identifies, logs, and escalates incidents, as needed, to assure tracking of remediation.\nThe CDC analyst assigned to the security event completes key fields about event details within ServiceNow before the ticket is closed. This provides the source of information about performance and operational issues, and documents identification and execution of remedial actions. Root Cause Analysis is used by the CDC following incident resolution as appropriate. The team sends metrics and reports to Senior Management.\nIT senior management receives a daily report from GCS that documents incidents.

Appropriate IT personnel research backups failures and resolve or escalate them through the incident management process described in the Production Processing section. Specific information about backup management processes are as follows:\n\u00b7 Mainframe applications and operating systems - Backup management tools have been configured to perform full backups weekly and incremental backups daily. In certain cases, tape backups are also performed. Applications and data are copied by backup management tools directly to virtual drives located at State Street's disaster recovery site.\n\u00b7 Linux (including applications in the Private Cloud), UNIX and Windows operating systems - Backup management and job scheduling tools have been configured to perform daily incremental backups of operating system and application data onto virtual tape libraries. The virtual tape libraries are also replicated daily to off-site recovery locations. For certain data that continues to be backed up to tape, backup management tools perform daily backups onto two sets of backup tapes. The first set of backup tapes is stored on-site, while the second set of backup tapes is sent to an off-site location.\n\u00b7 Tandem and OpenVMS operating systems - Real-time data replication occurs daily for Tandem and OpenVMS to off-site recovery locations. Operating system utilities and automated tools are used to schedule tape backups for Tandem and OpenVMS, respectively. Tape backups are performed using a combination of automated tool processes and tape management tools. The backup schedule is customized according to application needs. The schedule is implemented through automated tools for OpenVMS and Tandem.\nUpdate access to backup management tools is restricted to designated IT personnel based on job responsibilities and is reviewed on a periodic basis and at least once every calendar year by the State Street ISO or designated business or IT manager. The process for requesting and granting access to backup management tools follows the Access Administration process described in the Logical Access section.\nData Restore Process\nA service request ticket is created for data restore requests submitted through service request tools. Once the data restore has been performed by IT personnel, the business user who made the request is notified that the data restore has been completed. The service request tool is configured to request confirmation from the business user that the restore was completed as requested.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 45",

Business Continuity Planning\nState Street's Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Programs are part of the overall Operational Resilience umbrella. The objective of the Business Continuity program is to reduce the risk to service delivery in the event of a range of disruption scenarios (severe weather, pandemic, widespread power outage, geopolitical events). The program is overseen by Enterprise Continuity Services (\"ECS\"), a central function that defines program policy and standards that are applicable to all areas of State Street. The standards are designed for business functions and corporate areas to ensure that operational dependencies, including technologies and third parties, maintain an appropriate level of recovery capabilities commensurate with a range of disruption scenarios and that they are in line with overall service delivery and regulatory expectations.\nThe objective of the Disaster Recovery Program is to help ensure that our technology infrastructure can be recovered from events that impact our premises, infrastructure or data. It governs resilient designs in our architecture, coordinates regular testing of our capabilities and ensures that our recovery procedures meet our stringent requirements for predictability, timeliness and accuracy.\nB. Privacy and Data Protection Program\nThe Corporate Compliance Oversight Program supports State Street's compliance with laws and regulations that apply to its global business activities and functions. The program cultivates a culture in which compliance is an integral part of State Street's business environment and is recognized and rewarded in evaluating the performance of its business units and its employees.\nAs part of that effort, State Street has implemented the Global Privacy and Personal Data Protection Standard (\"Privacy Standard\") to address the practices that must be adhered to by all employees globally in order to comply with regulatory privacy and data protection requirements and best practices. The Privacy Standard has global applicability, and addresses certain jurisdictional implications and details, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 The coverage of the policy (processing and controlling of data, including collection of data and data minimization concepts)\n\u00b7 Roles and responsibilities\n\u00b7 Personal data protection principles\n\u00b7 Cross-border data transfers\n\u00b7 Breach management\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION V\n1",

The Global Privacy Office, led by the Global Head of Data Privacy, consists of global teams providing privacy compliance management.\nIn addition to the Privacy Standard and the oversight provided by the Global Privacy Office, business units and corporate functions assess privacy risk and the mitigating control environment as part of the annual Risk Control Self-Assessment (\"RCSA\") process, which takes into account operational and compliance risks. Privacy controls are periodically monitored and tested by Corporate Compliance and Corporate Audit.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION V\n2",

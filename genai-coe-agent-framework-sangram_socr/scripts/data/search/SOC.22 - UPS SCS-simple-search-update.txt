The service metrics contained in DRS include inventory accuracy, location accuracy, fulfillment accuracy (outbound results) and service failures (anything not meeting a customer requirement such as a missing item). Furthermore, key metrics surrounding receiving and shipping, on-time and quality are posted in various locations throughout the distribution centers. Some specific metrics for inventory and its accuracy include cycle counting and physical inventory results. In addition, management and supervisors hold routine meetings to discuss client service issues.\nMonitoring of activities is accomplished through a variety of methods. External monitoring includes regulatory compliance audits performed by the DEA, miscellaneous state agencies and sometimes the FDA, as well as drug testing and financial reports preparation and review by SCS.\nDepending on the level of risk exposure, SCS carries insurance coverage including commercial general liability, umbrella liability, and warehouseman's legal liability. This coverage is assessed annually to provide coverage for the upcoming policy period.\nOverview of operations\nGeneral information\nDescription of the primary applications\nUPS SCS utilizes the following systems to provide order-to-cash processing and inventory management services for our healthcare clients:\n. Global Healthcare Office Services (GHOS) is an integrated solution which utilizes Global Warehouse System (GWS)/Healthcare Enterprise Logistics Information and execution (HELIX), warehouse management systems (WMS) and interfaces with SAP, an enterprise resource planning system, to offer full order processing, accounts receivable, and inventory management functionality.\nHerein, the GWS/HELIX system may be referenced as 'WMS' when referring to shared descriptions of processes and control activities applicable to the system.\nApplications and computer hardware\nInformation technology used in Order-to-Cash processing is primarily supported by the UPS SCS IT Portfolio, located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Collectively, the primary applications used in Order-to-Cash processing are referred to as:\n\u00b7 GWS, which runs on servers using the Linux operating system and an Oracle database.\n\u00b7 HELIX, which runs on servers using Windows operating system and an Oracle database.\n. SAP, which is a suite of applications that run on servers using W2k8 operating system and SQL Server database.\nThe hardware environment is managed by the Technology Management Group's Distributed Computing team, and network administration and maintenance is the responsibility of the Telecommunications and Network Operations Command Center. Personnel at the warehouse distribution centers process orders, receive and ship client products using PC's and Symbol Radio Frequency (RF) Units.\nThe below table summarizes the SCS technology relevant to the report:\n<table><tr><th>Application Name</th><th>Modules</th><th>Database</th><th>Operating System</th><th>Network</th><th>Application/Module Description</th></tr><tr><td>I2-TMS (Canada Only)</td><td>N/A</td><td>DB2</td><td>AS/400</td><td>Windows AD</td><td>Transportation Management System (&quot;TMS&quot;)</td></tr><tr><td>GWS</td><td>WMS</td><td>Oracle</td><td>Linux</td><td>Windows AD</td><td>Warehouse Management System</td></tr><tr><td>HELIX</td><td>WMS</td><td>Oracle</td><td>Linux</td><td>Cloud Hosted</td><td>Warehouse Management System</td></tr></table>\n16",

A separate service auditor's report on the UPS Application Infrastructure and Operations group covers the relevant applications and technology and should be read in conjunction with this report.\nInventory and order processing systems\nSCS distribution centers utilize the WMS application to maintain client inventory. GWS functions as a WMS, which is licensed by Manhattan Associates. HELIX functions as another WMS, which is a SaaS application hosted and maintained by Softeon. For order processing, WMS interfaces with SAP.\nWMS/SAP maintains customer master files, vendor master files, inventory control, pricing, online and inbound EDI sales order entry, online and inbound EDI purchase order (PO) receipt entry, accounts receivables (A/R), DEA/ARCOS (Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System) reportable records and online and inbound EDI returns entry, and Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) processing.\nThe WMS system processes warehousing functions; such as, inbound receiving and returns processing, inventory put away, order picking, order shipping, inventory adjustments/status changes, bin replenishments and cycle counts. WMS is mainly driven through either the use of Radio Frequency bar code technology and/or online workstation entry. The WMS is interfaced with Transportation Management Systems (TMS) - I2TMS for Canada and UTMS for US, EU, LATAM and APAC regions.\nHealthcare compliance\nSCS warehouse facility compliance with Health Canada, Dutch Ministry of Health, Singapore Health Sciences Authority, Poland Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate, Philippines Food and Drug Administration Philippines, India Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, and the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), DEA, and FDA requirements are monitored and audited by the QA/RA team, as applicable. SCS is licensed by Health Canada, Dutch Ministry of Health, Singapore HSA, Poland GIF, Philippines FDA, India CDSCO, or the appropriate U.S. State and/or Federal Agencies, depending on jurisdiction and activities performed. Management members at each facility are required to review and ensure compliance with internally developed healthcare policies, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and work instructions (WIs). Members of the Healthcare Compliance and Corporate Internal Audit teams conduct periodic Internal Audits/Assessments of the healthcare facilities. The audits are comprehensive and include a review of procedure checks, storage facilities, appropriate licensing, and documentation requirements. The edits that occur during order entry, shipping and/or the inventory processes provide checks/balances and increase the assurance of a high level of data integrity for reporting detail on lot tracking, inventory control/reconciliation, and Health Canada, Dutch Ministry of Health, Singapore HSA, Poland GIF, Philippines FDA, India CDSCO, or U.S. Federal and/or State Government reporting requirements, as applicable.\nGovernmental reporting requirements\nIn Canada, there is a monthly sales report forwarded to the Office of Controlled Substances, covering transactions of Narcotic and Controlled Reportable Substances. Controlled drugs (raw material, bulk material, finished products, etc.) in the possession of the licensed dealer at the close of a fiscal year-end must be reported, except for controlled drugs that are destined for disposal. The quantities reported must be expressed using the total weight of the controlled substance and must include finished and bulk products.\nIn the Netherlands, the Ministry of Health regulates the healthcare industry. The organization has given authority to Farmatec for monitoring and licensing. A Good Distribution Practice (GDP) license is required for storage and distribution of pharmaceutical products; Good Manufacturing Practice License (GMP) is required for secondary packaging activities of pharmaceutical products; Controlled substances license is required for storage of controlled substances (two types: List I products license or List II products license).\nIn Singapore, UPS holds certain medical device importer and wholesaler licenses and also manages relevant import for re-export special authorization licenses issued by Health Sciences Authority Medical Device Branch,\n17",

        "content": "Accounts receivable control processes in place\nSCS provides, as part of the end-to-end order-to-cash services, certain clients with accounts receivable management services. The scope of A/R services begins after the invoice generation and once a shipment is manifested or shipped. The scope ends with the application of payments and reporting to the client. For clients that elect to use the SCS A/R services, SCS works with the client to create Work Instructions or Procedures manuals to detail each aspect of A/R processing.\nInvoicing\nSAP is configured to generate invoices once an order is identified as shipped and a systematic \"Post Goods Issue\" transaction is complete. For clients outsourcing their A/R processes to SCS, SCS creates the invoices. Once an invoice is created through SAP, it is forwarded to the customer via e-mail, fax, standard mail, or EDI transaction 810 (EDI standard code for an invoice). The date of the invoice is the date of the shipment stored in SAP. This is also the date that is used to age the invoice. Invoice amounts are based on the quantity shipped times the system price with applicable shipping charges added.\nCash receipts\nA/R clients utilize bank lockboxes to collect cash payments. Payments are sent directly to the bank for deposit, either by check, credit card, EFT or ACH transactions. Each SCS A/R client maintains its own lockbox to which SCS personnel are granted access. For some clients, the bank sends EDI messages throughout the day with details of payments posted to the lockbox. These payments are automatically posted to the customer's A/R account based on the check micro-number and invoice number. Cash that cannot be applied based on these criteria appears on the account as a payment on account (POA) and is researched by the accounts receivable associate (ARA) until resolved. For clients that do not have their payments electronically applied, the ARA applies the payments manually in SAP based on the information downloaded from the lockbox. Regardless of the method of cash application, cash receipts are matched and applied first by customer number and second by invoice number. Once payments are applied, the A/R balance is reduced by the payment amount. Credit card payments are applied either manually by the ARA or in the same manner as the lockbox payments. An ARA performs a reconciliation of credit card transactions to the SAP posting summary on a frequency determined by the client. The frequency required by each client is outlined in their respective work instructions. An ARA also performs a daily reconciliation of posted cash receipts to the advice statement of remittances deposited to the lockbox to determine that remittances posted to the lockbox are posted to the A/R accounts in SAP.\nUnapplied payments\nWhen a payment cannot be applied based on the customer/invoice match, the ARA researches the payment to determine the proper treatment. Once the correct customer account is identified, the ARA applies the payment to the customer account. Unapplied cash remains in the unapplied customer account until the ARA is able to resolve discrepancies and appropriately apply the cash. Most of these exceptions involve following up with the customer to determine which invoice a payment should be applied to. Once the ARA completes the research and the proper invoice is identified, the payment is manually applied. A/R associates for each client review unapplied cash on a daily basis to determine that payments are properly applied.\nShort/over payments, write-offs and exception handling\nThe Work Instruction Manual details, on a client-by-client basis, how to treat under/short payments. Though clients differ in the amounts of certain thresholds, the processes are generally the same. As part of each client's settings in SAP, a tolerance limit is set for short/over payments. The system automatically creates adjustments for short and over payments which fall within the tolerance levels set in SAP at the time of cash application. Clients have generally granted SCS a draft authority to manually write-off short/over-payments exceeding the tolerance limits in SAP with appropriate approval from SCS management, up to certain amounts. Short and over payments exceeding the draft authority are communicated to the client and any subsequent write-offs are approved by the client. The manual write-offs are posted via a miscellaneous discount code by the ARA during cash application. The manual write-offs are performed by the ARA and approved by a Team Lead or the A/R Supervisor.\nCollections\nAs part of the A/R management service package, SCS provides collection services for outstanding invoices in accordance with client specific Work Instructions and Procedures Manuals.

        "content": "SCS segregates products stored within their facilities by client to better facilitate counts and overall inventory accuracy. GWS and HELIX tracks the client owner and location of products within the warehouse.\nInventory accuracy trending\nGWS tracks inventory accuracy based on the number of locations counted during a particular period and the number of resulting adjustments. SCS distribution center management reviews inventory accuracy trending at least monthly to ensure that warehouse processes are functioning properly.\nIn HELIX Users can run Cycle Count reports that will list out and detail the locations and SKUs that were counted. Users can use this report to track the accuracy on the location level, SKU level, and total count accuracy\nHold adjustments\nThese adjustments involve a change in a product's status in WMS and are referred to as status changes. Product statuses fall into two major categories: 1) Saleable inventory and 2) non-sellable inventory. Clients utilize the ability to place product into a hold status to manage various aspects of inventory including preventing damaged inventory from being picked and shipped, holding a particular lot until another portion of the product sells for expiration date reasons, etc. Agreed upon procedures relating to inventory status changes are outlined in each client's work instructions. Clients generally do not require approvals for product to be placed into a hold status, but clients and the QA department do require approval from the client's QA personnel and SCS QA personnel, prior to product being released from a non-sellable hold to saleable inventory. Clients generally do not require approval for product which is being released from a sellable hold category. Appropriate approval, as defined by the client, is obtained prior to the product being released from a hold status.\nInventory trace\nThe inventory trace function in GWS provides the history of the transactions performed to move the product. An inventory trace is used in order to investigate discrepancies or to trace inventory. WMS provides the Activity Tracking Function in GWS that shows transactions by part, PO, sales order, ship to customer, location and user. Detail lines capture the transaction performed, time and date it was entered and the user who completed the transaction.\nTransaction History in HELIX will detail all transactions for a SKU, LOT, and LPN levels.\nShipping\nControl objective 6 - shipping\nControls provide reasonable assurance that goods shipped are recorded and reported completely and accurately on a timely basis.\nIn SAP, customer orders are received by SCS through EDI transfers from the client or customer or entered into SAP by the SCS CSR. If SCS is responsible for confirming the order, the CSR takes the necessary steps to confirm the order. Address format verification and drug license checks are examples of the verification done by the CSR. If orders are sent to SCS by the client in a confirmed status or once they are confirmed by the CSR, the order drops into the WMS module for picking.\nOnce dropped into WMS, the order can be viewed and assigned for picking. An order control associate assigns orders for picking and forwards/waves them to the pickticket inquiry pool based on certain criteria such as: carrier level, service level, part number, same ship to address, etc. The quantity of the product picked thereafter appears as \"Pick Assigned\" in WMS. In HELIX, the Operation could utilize WES (Warehouse Execution System) to auto wave incoming orders based on parameters set up by the Operation and Client needs.\nSome clients request SCS to create manual orders directly in GWS (WMS). As these orders are not processed through the SAP order-to-cash application, there are no systematic controls in place to prevent order entry for customers outside of the master file. As such, SCS Corporate performs an annual review of all GWS (WMS) manual orders across all in-scope clients to ascertain these manual orders were appropriate and authorized. Management will follow up with the responsible operations management personnel for additional explanations, as needed. Manual Orders are not utilized currently in HELIX, and all orders are processed to HELIX through GHOS (SAP).\n33",

Pricing changes are sent to SCS via e-mail or fax and follow the same procedure for approval as front-end contracts.\nEach night during the end-of-day processing, the system determines what invoices were created for each shipment dispatched that day and schedules them for printing the next day. End-of-day processing is monitored by IT System Operations. In the event there are errors they are unable to resolve, an issue is submitted to the Global Help Desk for escalation to the appropriate IT support group for resolution.\nSales order processing controls in place in Canada and Poland Customer accounts\nSales order processing (Canada)\nThe new customer account set-up process for Canadian clients is similar to the U.S. process described above. Most client's in Canada utilize the process of collecting new customer information internally and providing SCS with the information for client set-up once they have been approved along with their associated credit limit. See the U.S. narrative above for additional details regarding the new customer setup process.\nSales order processing in Canada is similar to the U.S. process in that SCS offers differing levels of service to order processing clients. Sales orders are received using the same channels described in the narrative above. Once sales orders are received and entered in SAP, the system determines that the order is for a valid customer. For clients whom SCS performs order processing services, SAP prevents sales orders from being processed for customers that do not exist in the client's Customer Master File. One time order processing also follows the same process as described in the narrative above.\nOnce the sales order is entered in SAP or sent by the client's system, the order advances to the WMS and then to TMS. TMS validates the order to determine if the shipping service noted on the order is available for the product and that the address is in the correct format. If exceptions arise from this validation, the order is put on hold until the issue is resolved.\nAfter the TMS validation, the order is forwarded to the pickticket inquiry pool in WMS and the order proceeds through the various statuses referenced above until the product is picked. It is then labeled for shipment using TMS. The process of labeling the order in TMS causes it to be forwarded to the Ship Pool in WMS. The packed order is now placed in a holding location awaiting carrier pickup.\nWhen the carrier arrives for pickup, the order is manifested in TMS along with other orders that the carrier is picking up. Manifesting the orders entails printing a report from TMS that lists the orders for pickup. One copy of the report is provided to the carrier and one is retained by SCS. The carrier signs the manifest to exchange custody of the product. Once the orders are manifested, the order is marked as shipped/dispatched in WMS and SAP generates invoices based on the product prices and quantities on the sales order. SAP assigns numbers to invoices generated by the system automatically and sequentially across all customers.\nSales order processing (Poland)\nSales orders processed from Poland are initially received via the same channels described above. Orders are entered into SAP and placed on hold until approval is received from the client to process the order. If a customer does not exist in the client master file, then a one-time customer order can be created only if client approval is received. After receiving client approval, the various shipping service level designation is input into SAP and the order transmits to GWS to be picked, packed & shipped from the UPS SCS Distribution Center.\nAccounts receivable management\nControl objective 2 - accounts receivable management Controls provide reasonable assurance that accounts receivable processing and cash collections are authorized, complete, accurate, and remittances are applied accurately on a timely basis.\nU.S. operations utilize the SAP systems to maintain clients' A/R. U.S. A/R management is administered from Newark Finance Center in the U.S., as well as Clark Finance Center in the Philippines and Pune Finance Center in India.\n24",

        "content": "For clients who utilize SCS for Accounts Receivable services, once SAP has determined that the order is for a valid customer, the system runs several checks of the customer's outstanding receivables based on system settings. SAP first determines that the customer does not have outstanding receivables which exceed the credit limit approved by the client and set-up in SAP. The system places sales orders on hold that would cause the customer to exceed its established credit limit in SAP. SAP also determines that the customer does not have receivables that have aged beyond the threshold established by the client. The system places customers on hold who have outstanding receivables that have aged past the threshold determined by the client. Sales Orders that are placed on hold are reviewed daily and resolved timely to prevent orders from remaining in an unnecessary hold status. This activity is performed by collectors assigned to the client and involves reviewing the held orders for a particular customer and the condition of their outstanding receivables. The collector normally places a call to the customer to determine if any payments are in-transit or if they would like to pre- pay for the held orders so the order will be processed. Clients generally grant SCS a draft authority which allows SCS to release orders that exceed the customer's credit limit up to the amount of the draft authority. There is generally a different draft authority granted for both SCS collectors and SCS management. These draft authorities are outlined in the client's agreed upon work instructions. If the collector is satisfied with the customer's payment history and/or the value of the order and the value falls within their draft authority, the collector releases the order. Orders which exceed the collector's draft authority are forwarded to a SCS manager for determination of disposition and approval for release. If the order exceeds the manager's draft authority, it is forwarded to the client with details of the customer's current A/R history and balance. The client then makes a determination as to whether to release the order and forwards SCS approval to release, if applicable. In all instances, appropriate approval, as defined by the client, is obtained prior to orders being released from credit hold.\nOnce the sales order is entered into SAP and released or the order is received by the client's business system in SAP and released, the order is forwarded to pickticket inquiry pool in GWS or order pool in HELIX. After the order is picked, packed, and checked (see control objective 6 narrative for a description of the warehouse pick/pack process) the order is noted with a \"weighed\" status in GWS. It is then labeled for shipment and the packed order is placed in a holding location awaiting carrier pickup. In HELIX after the order is picked, packed, and checked (see control objective 6 narrative for a description of the warehouse pick/pack process) the order is noted with a \"pack complete\" status, once the cartons are picked up by the carrier, then it is Closed, and the order moves to \"Shipment Closed\" status.\nIn GWS, UPS SCS-managed shipments are manifested after the order has been packed and routed and the shipping labels have been printed. The order will remain in a \"weighed\" status in GWS until it has been picked up by the carrier. Once the carrier has signed the shipping manifest and picked up the shipment, UPS SCS will then dispatch the order in WMS, and the status of the order will change to \"shipped/invoiced\". For orders which are picked up by the customer or are shipped by non-SCS managed carriers (as requested by the client), the orders will remain in a \"weighed\" status in GWS until the carrier arrives at the facility. Once the carrier has loaded the shipment on the truck and signed the bill of lading, the order is shipped/dispatched in WMS.\nIn HELIX, UPS SCS-managed shipments are manifested after the order has been packed and routed and the shipping labels have been printed. The order will remain in a \"packed\" status until it has been picked up by the carrier.

For orders which are picked up by the customer or are shipped by non-SCS managed carriers (as requested by the client), the orders will remain in a \"packed\" status until the carrier arrives at the facility. Once the carrier has loaded the shipment on the truck and signed the bill of lading, the order is closed in WMS.\nOnce orders are dispatched, SAP generates invoices based on the product prices and quantities on the sales orders. In addition, SAP automatically assigns sequential numbers to the invoices generated by the system. Invoices are sent from SCS to the customer in one of two ways, depending on the work instructions from the client. The first is via EDI transmission 810 (EDI standard code for an invoice). The EDI transmission to the customer occurs via batch processing each night. If the customer chooses not to receive EDI transmissions, the invoices are printed and either mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to the customer. For incomplete shipments, only those items that were shipped are invoiced. Items placed on backorder are invoiced separately once they are shipped. To determine invoice amounts, the client sends a front-end pricing contract to SCS via e-mail or fax. A SCS customer management associate (CMA) enters the pricing information into SAP. When the input of pricing information is complete, the CMA runs a report to display what was entered into the system. The pricing information is placed on hold and the report is sent to the client for approval. The client sends approval\n23",

Accounts can be set-up during the implementation process by using flat files or an electronic data interchange (EDI) 101 transaction. EDI 101 is the standard EDI transaction format for sending customer files. Post initial client implementation, customer accounts are set-up using the new customer account set-up process. To set-up a new customer, an Account Information Sheet (AIS) is created by the Master Data Maintenance (MDM) team to capture the information necessary to create a new customer including name, address, billing information and other requirements. If requested by the client, the Accounts Receivable Associate (ARA) conducts a credit check on the prospective customer using the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) business ratings or a similar service to propose a credit limit. The information (AIS, D&B report and proposed credit limit) is forwarded to the client for approval. Once the client approves the customer along with the credit limit, the MDM associate adds the new customer to the customer master file. Some clients handle the initial client data gathering process internally and simply forward the customer's information to SCS once they have been approved.\nAll changes to the customer master file receive client approval prior to the change being made. The request for change is completed by the File Maintenance Administrator or the MDM group. The request is then given back to the requestor who is advised that the change has been made. The requestor verifies the accuracy of the change and then forwards the paperwork back to the MDM group for either filing or correcting, as needed.\nSales order processing (US, India and Philippines)\nSCS provides differing levels of service for order processing and A/R customers. Additionally, the process for receiving sales orders differs depending on the level of service. For certain clients, SCS functions as the client's customer service department and receives sales orders directly from the client's customers via phone, fax, e-mail or EDI. Other clients choose to maintain their customer service department internally and forward customer orders to SCS via EDI. Regardless of how the order is received, be it through a Customer Service Representative (\"CSR\") entering the order, or receipt of an EDI, the order goes through several edit checks prior to being dropped to the warehouse for fulfillment. SAP first checks to determine that the customer is valid and has been previously set-up in SAP. SAP will not process sales orders for customers that do not exist in the client's customer master files. However, at the request of the client, manual drop ship orders can be created for customers not in the client's customer master file. In these cases, a ship-to customer number of X10000 is used and the information (customer name, address, and other required information) sent by the client is entered manually. For clients who request UPS to process one-time orders for customers outside of the master file, client approval must be obtained prior to processing orders.\n22",

        "content": "exception that shipments are not staged outside of the cage/vault area during the receiving process. Shipments are offloaded and taken directly to the appropriate restricted area.\nGWS Inbound\nThe warehouse associate verifies the product and applicable information listed on the packing slip or ASN (via the Inbound Shipment Report in GWS) matches the product physically received. Applicable information can include part number, lot/serial number and expiration date.\nInbound shipments are received in GWS via ASNs or PO (Purchase Orders). For some clients the ASN/PO must be created by the receiver using the bill of lading (BOL)/packing list/advanced communication from client to determine the products expected. For certain clients, the ASN/PO is created in SAP or sent from the client via EDI feed. If there are discrepancies, applicable work instructions are followed. Work instructions may indicate that the ASN/PO is altered to match the packing list or that the discrepant product will be segregated and placed into an exceptions area while awaiting disposition from the client. This allows the receiver to enter information regarding the shipment including the carrier, trailer number, bill of lading number, appointment time and other necessary information. Once this is completed, the ASN/PO is created in WMS for inbound shipments generated in GWS and the shipment can be received either manually or using the RF device.\nThe receiver creates the case in the system using the ASN receiving function on the RF device. Upon selecting the receiving function, the receiver is prompted to enter an ASN number or scan the Inbound Shipment Report and then the Case ID/License Plate Number (\"LPN\") label. If the ASN number provided has not been created in WMS, an invalid ASN error message is displayed, and the receiver is prevented from continuing with the receipt until a valid ASN is provided. Once a valid ASN is entered, the receiver creates the case by scanning the LPN placed on the pallet and confirming the batch number and entering the quantity in the RF device, as the SKU, and expiration date are already systematically generated based off of the ASN. GWS will only allow one SKU and one batch from one ASN to be assigned to each LPN. GWS can optionally capture country of origin and pack quantities. The quantity entered is determined by the physical count performed during initial verification. Certain clients' work instructions require that products be received into a hold status. Upon notification of inbound hold requests, which may be established at a client, part or lot number level, SCS has the capability to ensure that the product will automatically be placed on hold by GWS without manual intervention at the time of receipt. In this scenario, a hold code, usually \"QH\" or \"QU,\" is provided when creating the case in the system. This process is repeated for pallets associated with the ASN. At this point the product is ready to be put away and the receiver prints the ASN variance report (in GWS) which are retained in the receipt documentation. In GWS, the ASN variance report confirms any variances between the products received and products expected and is retained in the receipt documentation along with the Inbound Shipment report.\nIf a discrepancy is noted between the product received and product expected on the ASN, a second physical count is performed by an individual other than the original receiver who verified the product quantities to confirm the quantity received. If required by the client, a second physical count is performed for all inbound shipments, regardless if there is a variance. This second count is sometimes, but not always, performed by the receiver. Any discrepancies between the quantities are resolved prior to closing the ASN for GWS. On- hand inventory is updated automatically by GWS as the product is received.\nReceiving supervisors monitor that all products received into inventory have been put away. To put away the product, the put away person scans the LPN on a pallet. In GWS, after scanning the LPN the RF device prompts for the put away location or an open location is chosen by the put away associate. The product is then transferred to an open bin location. The LPN for that bin is scanned to locate the product in that bin within GWS. At most facilities, GWS is configured so that it will not allow sellable product to be put away to a bin that is not available or contains products with different SKUs or batch numbers.\nIn GWS, inventory is incremented in the system when products are first received/scanned with the RF device. Prior to the put away of the product, receiving personnel will print the ASN Variance Report in GWS, which lists any variances between the SKUs, quantities, and lot numbers expected in the system per the ASN and the products actually received. All products must be assigned to an LPN/case ID during the receiving process. Any variances identified are investigated and communicated to the client per the work instructions. If no variances are identified, the supervisor or designee will \"verify\" the ASN, thus closing the ASN. After the put away of the product, receiving personnel will monitor the Inbound Shipment Maintenance and Case Inquiry screens in GWS to confirm all cases have systematically been put away in GWS.\n27",

Collection activity continues until either payment is received or the invoice is deemed uncollectible. Once a customer denies payment, the issue is then escalated to the A/R Supervisor and/or client, based on the Work Instructions and Procedures Manuals, to determine if the account should be written- off or if further collection activities should be pursued.\nMonth end reconciliations\nAt the end of each month, an ending balance worksheet is created to verify that the total of the previous month's ending A/R balance, current period's sales, cash received, and adjustments/reconciling items agree to the ending A/R balance for the current period. The completed worksheet is reviewed and approved by an A/R Supervisor. Discrepancies are noted and communicated to the client. If the month end worksheet does not balance, the item is put on the roll forward as a reconciling item and provided to the client. The ARA or supervisor continues to research the item to determine resolution. The month end process is not considered complete until the month end roll-forward reconciles. Clients are also provided with daily transaction data by either an overnight file transfer protocol (FTP) feed that is uploaded by the client into its own financial application, or by accessing SAP remotely.\nSegregation of duties\nSCS collection employees do not have system access to create new sales orders. This segregation of duties is in place because the sales order entry screen can also be used to enter credit memos.\nReceiving\nControl objective 3 - receiving\nControls provide reasonable assurance that goods received are recorded and reported completely and accurately on a timely basis.\nWhen a shipment is received, a visual inspection of the trailer is performed. This inspection includes visually noting the general condition of the interior and exterior of the truck including a visual check for infestation, temperature inside the trailer for cold storage product as well as whether pallets have tipped over in-transit or other noticeable damage. If the trailer has an intact seal, which may not be the case for less than truck load (LTL) shipments, the receiver also compares the seal number noted on the freight bill to the seal on the trailer to confirm that the contents have not been altered during transit. The shipment is then offloaded to the dock and a visual inspection performed. Visible damage is noted on the carrier's freight bill. The receiver reviews the freight bill and, depending on client work instructions, either performs a count of the product prior to releasing the truck or stamps/signs that the shipment is received, but subject to future count and/or inspection. The shipment is then transferred to a designated warehouse location for processing.\nThe warehouse associate breaks down the shipment so that each pallet contains only a single product with a single lot number and expiration date. This is done to prevent multiple lots with different expiration dates from being stored in the same bin location. If multiple advanced shipping notices (ASNs) are shipped on the same freight bill, the product is broken down to allow each ASN to be received separately. Once the product has been segregated, the receiver places temporary identification labels (license plate numbers (LPN)/case ID numbers) on each pallet. This allows the receiver to assign a certain product relating to a particular ASN to that specific LPN/case ID so that it can be scanned into a bin location using the RF devices at a future time.\nFor clients set-up to receive inbound receipt confirmations via EDI transmissions, an EDI receipt (warehouse stock transfer receipt advice) confirmation message is sent to the client when the ASN is closed.\nCertain distribution centers house products requiring cold storage. At these facilities, the products are housed in the appropriate temperature-controlled ranges (cooler or freezer) based on client dictated storage conditions. Receiving procedures for cold storage products are the same as noted above with the exception that shipments are not staged outside the appropriate temperature range if the product excursion rates do not permit during the receiving process. Shipments are offloaded and taken directly to the appropriate temperature area, which is dependent on the client work instructions.\nCertain distribution centers house DEA schedule drugs. At these facilities, schedules 3 through 5 drugs (controlled substances) are housed in a secure cage area with restricted access. Schedule 2 drugs are housed in a vault within the cage. Receiving procedures for schedule drugs are the same as noted above with the\n26",

        "content": "GWS is configured for some clients and locations to automatically receive returned products on a hold status; however, this configuration may not be in place for some clients/locations, as some clients authorize SCS to receive returned products directly into sellable status. For returns processed via inventory adjustments, all products are manually placed on a hold status, unless otherwise specified by the client. Disposition of a returned product is determined according to client work instructions. In most cases, the client QA department is forwarded a copy of the return paperwork and determines whether the product is destroyed or returned to good stock. For a few clients, SCS makes this determination for the client based on a set of criteria defined in the client's work instructions. In either case, appropriate approval, as defined by the client, is obtained prior to releasing returned product to saleable inventory. Returned product is either stored in a secured returns area or physically identified as on-hold and not available for picking prior to being removed from the non-sellable hold category.\nHELIX Returns Processing\nWhen a Return shipment is delivered to the Inbound Dock, it should be preceded by an RMA (Return Material Authorization) sent by the client. If there is not an RMA present in HELIX at the time of Return arrival, the operation should refer to their SOP on unauthorized RMAs. This RMA will create a Return Receipt, that will be processed in the same manner as a Normal Receipt. The differences between a Normal Receipt and a Return Receipt are the Disposition Codes that can be assigned to the LPN either at the Receipt Header level (Sent by the Customer), or by the Receiver at the time of Receipt in the RF Device. The Disposition is the Reason Code as to why the shipment was returned. This code is transmitted back to the client when the Return Receipt is closed. The second difference is that all Returns are received on to RTRN Hold, unless determined otherwise by the client. This can be removed once the Client has approved the return for sellable stock. The RTRN hold is also used to help segregate RTRN stock from Normal stock until the RTRN is removed. HELIX uses this hold to suggest assigned Zones\\Locations for putaway for RTRN Product. HELIX has a Return Receipt Report that can be generated to list only Returns Receipts received for a date range. The report will list out Receipt, receive date, RMA#, SKU, QTY and Disposition code assigned to the LPN. An Inventory Hold Report can be generated out of BOBJ for all inventory that is on RTRN hold.\nInventory maintenance and tracking\nControl objective 5 - inventory maintenance and tracking\nControls provide reasonable assurance that inventory is accurately maintained and reported on a timely basis and changes to the inventory balances are authorized.\nInventory counts and adjustments\nSCS conducts inventory counts to compare the physical inventory on hand against the inventory listed in the WMS (HELIX and GWS). Inventory counts can be regularly scheduled, requested by the client, or initiated by SCS for a variety of reasons, as described below.\nCycle counting/Full Physical Inventory\nCycle Counts and/or physical inventories are performed on a frequency determined by the client. Unless a less frequent count is requested by the client, all SKUs and /or product locations are counted on at least a quarterly basis. If discrepancies are noted during the cycle count process and are confirmed, the discrepancy is recorded in GWS in a timely manner. The agreed-upon frequency is outlined in each client's work instructions and/or client specific form referred to in the client's work instructions. The distribution center manager is responsible for establishing and enforcing an inventory count routine which complies with the client's specific work instructions. The types of inventory count requirements generally fall into the following categories:\n. Daily active location - GWS and HELIX have the ability to generate an active locations report for the day. Some clients require that each active location for the day be counted. The report will show all of the locations which were put away to, replenished to/from or picked from. The report will not show locations that did not experience any activity that day.\n. ABC schedule - GWS and HELIX has the ability to generate a counting schedule based on products being ranked either A, B or C. A type products would be those that the client wants counted most frequently, B types would be counted less frequently, and C types counted the least frequently. Product classifications are determined by the clients and reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain appropriate based on the level of product activity.\n31",

The product should not be soiled, the packaging must be intact and the product must have appropriate expiration dating. The employee responsible for the outbound provides a double check of the order before final boxing/wrapping for shipment. Shortages that are discovered are brought to the attention of the supervisor or designee and corrections are made. Returned products are received into a hold status. The hold status can be return hold (for products that are not physically damaged and are not expired or close to expiration) or return damaged hold (for products deemed not saleable). Returns are processed according to the following return procedures:\n\u00b7 Unauthorized return information is logged (carrier name, shipment tracking number, shipper address, client, date) by a returns associate.\n. Each return is issued an RGA number. Some clients provide this number, if not; the returns associate creates an RGA utilizing the number that GWS assigns.\n. The authorization number remains associated with the return.\n. The client decides how returns should be handled with the information documented in the work instruction or the client is forwarded the information regarding the return and makes the decision, in writing, as to when or if the product may return to good status.\n. Unauthorized Returns Process does is not currently supported in HELIX. All Returns must be resolved with the Client and a RMA or Receipt will need to be provided in order to put the stock into the WMS\nExpired product\nWhen applicable, short-dated (SD, RRSD) or expired (EX, BLEX) product is reported to the client via the inventory representative. A system-generated report is forwarded to the client (monthly) to indicate inventory status. Per the client specific work instructions, SD/RRSD product is manually placed on hold in GWS, and systemically placed on hold, then report transmitted to client; EX/BLEX product is automatically placed on hold and report transmitted to the client. The system allows for certain lots, quantities and parts to be placed on hold. If authorized in writing, product deemed not saleable can be destroyed. The client is provided with a list of products in hold status and the client determines the products to be destroyed. The client Work Instructions or Procedures Manuals detail the process for destroying product. After destruction, the client is forwarded confirmation. The SCS facility retains records in the system of transactions outlined above. The company who manages the destruction process (holds the contract with the destruction company) is responsible for acquiring and distributing the Certificate of Destruction provided by the destruction company after disposal, UPS must always have a copy of the certificate of destruction. In the case of controlled substances and the client managing the destruction process, a copy of the Certificate of Destruction must be provided to SCS for record retention as well.\nRecord keeping elements refer also to Control Objective 5 - inventory maintenance and tracking\nReceiving\nThe GWS system provides detailed recording features. Inbound shipments have a PO number automatically assigned if required by the customer. An ASN number is automatically created from the PO. In GWS, a receiving report is generated. In GWS, an ASN variance report is created and will display any variances between the quantities listed on the ASN and the quantities received. An alternate receiver reviews the ASN variance report in GWS and closes the ASN if there are no discrepancies. The reconciliation report is forwarded to the CMA/CSR. The CMA/CSR submits to the client a report containing relevant shipment information (e.g., shipper name and address, receipt date, receipt units and lots).\nThe HELIX WMS provides detailed recording features. A receipt is created for every ASN. Currently PO Creation is not available in HELIX. There is an ASN Variance report that details any variances between qtys listed on the receipt when it is closed. This report is utilized by Operations Management to verify that all qtys match when the receipt was closed, and note any variances that may have existed and approved prior to closing.\nInventory\nOperations management must approve the inventory adjustments for certain clients, prior to entering them into the system. An inventory representative investigates the adjustments. Cycle counts are completed according to client specific Work Instructions or Procedures Manuals.

The user will scan the LPN and the WMS will suggest locations based on criteria set up for that client's SKU. HELIX will suggest locations based on storage type (Active. Reserve), Zone (Ambient, Cooler, etc) SKU Type (HAZMAT), and Product status (Sellable or NON-Sellable). If the LPN being put away requires storage in a certain Zone, the WMS will not allow the user to put that LPN in a zone that does not meet the storage requirements set up for that SKU in the SKU Profile in HELIX. The user will be suggested the location that meets the storage requirements of the LPN. If the location suggested is not available or is not ideal for the LPN being put away, the user is able to skip to a new suggested location or scan a new location. The location chosen by the user must meet the storage requirements set up for the SKU assigned to the LPN. If not, the WMS will not allow the user to systemically put the product in the location. If the location being chosen by the user meets the storage requirements, the user will be prompted in the RF device to select a Reason Code that will mark the reason the suggested location was overridden by the user.\nProduct status\nSCS currently utilizes various client specific status categories to help maintain accurate client inventory:\n\u2022 Good - received product that can be picked, packed and shipped.\n\u00b7 Not Sellable Hold - this status includes a variety of hold codes, such as quarantine or damage, to control inventory based on client needs. Products that are on hold cannot be picked for shipment unless the order specifies that particular part number, lot number, expiration date and hold category. Signed authorization from the client's quality assurance (QA) personnel and SCS QA personnel must be obtained prior to the shipment and the destination address can only be the client, the product manufacturer, an authorized destruction company or an authorized testing facility.\n. Sellable Hold - this status includes a couple of hold codes such as client hold or short-dated hold, dependent on client specifications. Products on client hold cannot be picked for shipment unless the order specifies that part number, lot number, expiration date, and hold category. Shipments from a sellable hold code typically require authorization from the client, but not SCS QA personnel.\n\u00b7 Released - product which was previously on hold and is now approved for pick, pack, and ship.\nInternal transfers for replenishment\nThere are two processes for the replenishment of product to the primary pick location: the regular overnight replenishments and the intra-day replenishments.\n\u00b7 GWS Regular overnight replenishments - The primary location bins are set up in the Bin Maintenance Menu with a minimum and maximum quantity. If a primary bin is below the minimum quantity specified at the end of the day, a replenishment order is automatically generated to bring the bin up to maximum quantity. The orders are then executed by the replenishment team.\n\u2022 GWS Intra-day replenishments - If during a working day a picker is assigned a pick order and the primary or alternate location for that particular product is empty or has insufficient stock to fill the order, the picker notes an exception code of \"E\" on the RF device. In GWS, a cycle count can be triggered to inform an inventory control specialist to ascertain the inventory in the location. This initiates the intra-day replenishment order that is filled by the replenishment team during the day.\n. HELIX Replenishments - are performed \"On Demand\". When there is demand for the SKU for waves that are ready, the system will kick off tasks based on priority of the pick tasks to move that product to Active locations for picking.\nThe product used to replenish the primary location is automatically selected by the system. Generally, the FEFO (First Expiration, First Out) stock rule applies. Products that do not have an expiration date (Literature, Pamphlets, etc.) are selected based on the FIFO (First In, First Out) method.\n29",

Movement and storage of the inventory, as well as the construction of the buildings where inventory is warehoused, are subject to regulatory review. Computer systems are validated to ensure regulated data is captured and maintained in a manner to ensure global compliance requirements. Each distribution center has an assigned QA representative that is responsible for determining that the distribution center is complying with the established UPS SCS Healthcare quality system, which is developed to satisfy both internal and regulatory requirements.\nDistribution center management and the QA representative perform self-assessments of the healthcare facilities at least every three years. The self-assessment is comprehensive and includes a review of procedure checks, storage facilities, and required documentation. The self-assessment is designed to monitor compliance with the established UPS SCS Healthcare quality system, and to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements that govern each distribution center. The edits that occur during order entry, shipping and the inventory processes provide checks/balances so that a high level of data integrity occurs for reporting detail on lot tracking and inventory reconciliations, and for reporting information to the U.S. Federal and U.S. State Government, Health Canada, Dutch Ministry of Health, Poland Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate, Philippines Food and Drug Administration, India Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, or Singapore Health Sciences Authority, as applicable.\nFacilities\nBuildings are constructed to facilitate cleaning, maintenance and proper operation. Facilities provide adequate lighting, ventilation and regulated temperature. Changes and enhancements are made to each facility as required to keep them in compliance with laws and regulations and to keep them safe and secure from theft. Periodic preventive maintenance is performed on select product-impacting equipment. Preventive maintenance is performed by trained personnel, is documented and is monitored specifically by the Facilities Engineering Department or branch designee.\nQuarantined product is clearly marked (e.g., bagged/placarded), and if space constraints allow, is physically separated from sellable inventory. The GWS and HELIX applications provides features for inbound shipments to be received in a quarantine/quality hold status and put away directly to designated areas, with the appropriate hold code or location lock code placed on each item in the system per each client's specific work instructions and the Corporate Healthcare SOPs. These inbound shipments may be distinguished after receipt by placement of a red quarantine label (International) or a red bag with Non-Sellable printed on it (US), on each pallet. All non-sellable product is also on hold systematically. Once release documentation is received from the client QA, the product is released in the system.\nProducts are maintained in a clean and orderly condition by warehouse associates assigned to specific housekeeping areas. Members of the sanitation committee monitor the housekeeping assignments and results and communicate discrepancies to management.\nSecurity\nRefer to Control Objective 7 - physical security - distribution centers.\nExamination of product\nIt is the responsibility of the receiving associate to examine inbound shipments. The receiving associate verifies that trailer seals are intact upon arrival and the product has not been stored with unauthorized materials (e.g. hazardous product). If a delivery is deemed unfit for distribution, the clerk takes a photograph of the shipment. Supervisors are informed of discrepancies involving acceptance of shipments. After unloading the shipment, the clerk inspects the freight for damage, and if damage is detected, a notation is put on the truck BOL. After completing notations and inspections, the clerk signs the truck BOL. If a delivery is deemed unfit for acceptance/distribution while on the truck or once in the facility, the associate notified management immediately for further direction/disposition instruction.\n37",

        "content": "Most warehouse associates use RF devices to conduct the picking process for both systems, although sometimes this process is still performed manually. In addition, some facilities using GWS and HELIX and their RF devices utilize the Pick-to-Light (PTL) pick-pack process.\nIn GWS, the RF device communicates with WMS to determine the proper picking location for the product. In the GWS PTL environment, the warehouse associate scans the global license pallet (GLP) box label and a light directly under the specified bin becomes lit. The GWS system prevents the picker from picking a product/SKU which is on hold or from a location other than the bin/SKU specified by the RF device. After the picker types in the correct location in the RF device or after scanning the GLP box label (for the PTL environment), the picker picks each unit requested. GWS and HELIX have the capability of scanning the bar code product label if the product information and format contained on the label is uniform for all of that client's products. The picker performs a visual validation of the part ID, lot number and quantity prior to removing the product from the location and confirming the product on the RF device. In GWS and HELIX with PTL picking, the button below the light must be pressed after the product is picked before the next order is processed. In WMS, on-hand inventory for the product is decremented real-time upon picking and is no longer available for allocation.\nSome facilities print the pick/pack list after picking and some print the pick/pack list at the time of order release. In GWS the pick document prints at the time of order release and the packing list prints when the last carton in that order is systematically \"shipped\". The order is now in a 'weighed' status, depending on the type of order, and the order can now be viewed in the WMS shipping pool. At this point, a quality control (QC) check is performed on the order, which entails confirming the parts, lot numbers, expiration dates and quantities of the products picked for the shipment match the pick/pack list. This QC check is performed by an employee other than the picker. At most facilities, the employee performing the QC check also signs-off on the pick/pack list and either packs the shipment or if the shipment is correct, another employee will process the order for shipment by scanning the carton contents label. Once the label is scanned a packing slip will print and will either be placed inside the container or will be attached to the outside of the container concealed in a packing slip envelope. The container will then be sealed, or the pallet will be wrapped for shipment if it is an LTL shipment.\nIn HELIX the Wave Planner or Warehouse Execution System will wave orders based on preset criteria. The wave will create tasks that can be accessed for picking via the RF Device. The Picker will input the proper criteria in the RF Device and be given tasks to complete based on that criteria. The Picker will then be directed to what box types to use, assign the preprinted SCNs, and begin picking that cluster of pick tasks until the cartons are complete and all picks have been completed. All orders on that task move from 'In Picking\" to \"Pick Complete\". The completed picked cartons are then QC'd by someone other than the picker in the RF Device. The SCNs are locked and unshippable until a successful audit is complete. Once the audit is complete, the SCN is unlocked and ready for packing. The carton is then moved to a Pack Station where a user will scan the SCN into the WMS, verify the information on the screen, and \"Pack\" the carton. The tracking label is printed and placed on the sealed carton, and if it is the last SCN on the Order, a pack list will print. The Order is not in \"Pack Complete\" status.\nSCS has the ability to cartonize outbound orders. Depending on the client and the work instructions associated with that particular client, the warehouse associate will notate which shipping carton and pallet each unit requested on the order has been placed. The order is cartonized systematically in WMS and a label specific to each carton and pallet will be printed and applied to the appropriate carton/pallet.\nProgressing further through the shipping line, the shipper confirms that the physical number of pallets or boxes matches the number indicated on the pick/pack list by the quality checker to determine that the complete order has progressed through the process. The shipper will utilize the shipping system to verify the shipping information entered or uploaded into the system and that the order matches the information listed on the office copy of the packing slip. This is done to complete the shipping process in the system. Next, the shipper prints the shipping label. Once the shipping label is printed, it is attached to the shipment. The boxes or pallets are then placed in a designated location for pickup by the carrier. Once the order is staged for shipping, it is now in a 'weighed' status and the order can be viewed in the WMS shipping pool.\nIn HELIX all LTL / TL orders are staged systemically into a stage lane where they will be audited, wrapped, and labeled. Once the shipment is ready it will be placed on a \"Truck\". This Truck is a systematic representation of a LTL Truck, and the user can put any orders that will be picked up by that Truck on it. The Pro Numbers are assigned to each order individually. The Truck cannot be closed until the pallets, or SPNs, are loaded on to the trailer via the RF Device. The user is able to input the trailer number and dock door number\n34",

        "content": "\u00b7 Part based - Certain clients establish a time frame in which they require that all parts stored by SCS be counted on a periodic basis such as every six months. In addition to the time frame, the count basis can be established based on pick activity, such as every 500 picks. How this requirement is achieved is up to the DC management. HELIX has the ability to schedule Cycle Counts based on this criteria.\n\u00b7 Triggers - Cycle counts can also be triggered by various events within the WMS (GWS and HELIX) like short picks, picking to zero quantity and so on.\nInventory investigation\nAn inventory investigation count is prompted by an issue relating to shipping such as an over shipment or under shipment. It could also be the result of a discrepancy noted during the picking process. Upon the discovery of an issue, the inventory analysts count locations that can be identified as the source of the problem. The inventory analyst then completes the warehouse investigation portion with the appropriate documentation listing the findings of the investigation. Examples of appropriate documentation include, but are not limited to, an exception report, customer error log or Inventory Control Department sheet. Regardless of the type of count, the inventory analyst determines the items or locations to be counted with the help of the WMS modules. There are two count methods: a paper-based environment and a paperless/RF environment. In HELIX all counts are paperless.\nIn a paper-based environment, the inventory analyst either conducts the count or designates a warehouse employee to conduct the count. The counter is issued an inventory count report from WMS to record the results of the count. After the count is conducted, quantities are reconciled between WMS and the physical inventory. When a discrepancy is noted between the quantity physically counted and the on-hand quantity reported by WMS, a second count is performed by an independent individual to validate the findings. If the count is validated, an adjustment is made with a completed inventory adjustment form. This form includes the part ID, lot number, quantity to be adjusted and the appropriate approvals. The approvals required by each client for inventory adjustments and the timing of the approvals, if applicable, are outlined in the respective work instructions. Appropriate approvals, as defined by the client, are obtained for inventory adjustments.\nIn a paperless environment, the inventory analyst either conducts the count or designates a warehouse employee to conduct the count. The counter will log into the RF equipment and select the cycle count function. The RF equipment directs the employee to the location which requires counting. The counter will scan the location identification label. If the counter scans the incorrect location, the RF equipment notifies the counter of the error. Once the correct location is scanned and the SKU/Case ID, the Batch and SKU Description will appear on the RF equipment. The RF equipment will request the counter to enter the number of units found in the location. If the product has multiple packaging levels such as a case and a box level, the counter enters the number of cases and the number of additional individual units. If the physical quantity entered into the RF equipment matches the systematic quantity in WMS, the RF equipment assists the individual who is counting the inventory and will display the next location requiring a cycle count. The cycle count will then be listed as processed in the system. If the physical and systematic counts are different, then the RF equipment will notify the counter of an error and request the counter to verify the information which was previously entered. The counter will verify the count. If the counts still do not match, the count record for that particular SKU, lot, expiration date and quantity at that location will be recorded and the stock level will be adjusted once the count record is approved by the inventory analyst. A cycle count report is generated and any discrepancies which are listed on the report will be documented on an adjustment form. For client's setup to receive inventory adjustment confirmations via EDI transmissions, an EDI 947 adjustment confirmation message is sent to the client when an inventory adjustment is made in the system. The inventory analyst will generate another cycle count request in WMS to be completed for the discrepancy. A second individual will follow the same process as the first counter and will count the location as a second verification. In the GWS system, this cycle count discrepancy can automatically trigger the discrepant quantity to be placed on hold as well as the generation of a second cycle count task. In HELIX the only time a location is placed on hold is when an Emergency Count has been triggered via the RF gun when a picker marks an over ridden location as \"Empty\" or \"Damaged\".\nIn GWS and HELIX environment, the cycle counts are usually performed \"blind.\" The counter does not have visibility to the inventory stock level listed in WMS. Counts requesting non-sellable hold codes in GWS are not to be performed by the RF device; and products associated with a non-sellable hold code cannot be adjusted without prior authorization from client QA personnel and SCS QA personnel. In HELIX, counts requesting non- sellable hold codes can be performed through the RF device utilizing a Cycle Count Schedule created specifically for the requested hold code, or for all non-sellable hold codes in non-sellable locations.\n32",

Applicable information can include SKU, LOT, serial numbers and expiration dates.\nInbound shipments are received into HELIX via a Receipt. The Receipt is the identifier assigned to an ASN when it is loaded into the WMS. If discrepancies are found between the physical shipment and what is showing on the receipt, the receiver will refer to their SOPs or corresponding Work Instructions on discrepant Inbound Shipments. Currently there are no manual creation of Receipts process in HELIX. If the Client SOP allows receiving the receipt short, this is allowed in the WMS, however receiving over the listed quantity is not allowed. In the cases of a physical overage, the Client will need to direct the operations on how to receive the overage into the WMS.\nThe HELIX receiver will print out \"Blind LPN\" labels prior to receiving the product. The LPNs are based on a counter in HELIX and will move forward to where the last number ended in the batch printed by the receiver. The receiver will receive the Receipt in the RF device. The user will input the Receipt Number into the RF device, if the receipt number input into the screen, the user will receive an \"Invalid Receipt Number\" error. The user must put in the Receipt number that is associated with the ASN / Shipment they are receiving. Once the correct receipt number is input into the device the user will then input the LPN they are assigning to the product being received, as well as the SKU, LOT, and Expiration Date. If COO is mandatory for that Client, the user will be prompted to enter it. If the product being received has not been received into the WMS before, the user will be prompted to \"Verify the Product\". The user is required to verify the DIMs of the tracked UOMs listed in the SKU Profile of the WMS. Helix requires this process to be performed for first time receipts, and the user is not allowed to continue with the receiving of the SKU until this is performed. Once DIMs are verified, the user can input the UOM quantity being received and submit the information in the RF Device. When the LPN is submitted, the quantity assigned to the LPN will list as received on the Receipt detail in HELIX. The receiver will perform these functions until all the physical product on the shipment is received into the WMS.\nAll LPNs received into HELIX are placed on INIH hold. This hold is to ensure that all LPNs received are verified through an audit performed by the user in the RF device. All LPNs are placed on a QURL hold if mandated by that client, and the SKU is set up to be on a QURL hold in the SKU Profile within HELIX.\nThe receiver will then go into HELIX and close the receipt. If the user is closing a receipt and not all the quantities listed in the receipt have been received, the WMS will provide an error stating \"Variance in qtys exist\". The user will then verify the physical qtys to the systemic qtys received. They can perform this by printing the ASN Variance Report in HELIX. If the variances are true, and approved, the user is allowed to close the receipt short. If no variances exist at the time of close, then the user will continue to close. Once the WMS moves the receipt from Open or \"In receiving\" to Close, the WMS will provide Receipt Reports that can be printed or downloaded. If the client that the product is being received for is set up to receive confirmation of receipt close, then at this time a 944 message will be sent via EDI to the client informing them the ASN is closed. The ASN must be closed to put away the LPNs that have been received.\nThe receiver is now able to perform the Inbound Audits on the LPNs that are required to remove the INIH hold on the LPNs prior to putting the LPNs into locations. HELIX requires an audit of all LPNs on a receipt prior to put away, and users are not able to put away LPNs until they have been successfully audited.\nPut away rules\nGWS\nWhen an employee scans a potential case ID/LPN to locate a product, GWS can perform a check of pre- defined criteria (if applicable) to determine if that location is appropriate for the product. This check is a comparison of attributes of the product to those of the bin. The attributes used for this check are defined in the put options menu located in the distribution center (DC) configuration section of the set-up menu tab. A possible scenario is that bins are reserved for particular clients. During the bin set-up, a client can be specified as the owner in the attributes of the bin. If the put away person attempts to locate another client's product in a bin that is assigned to a different client, an error message is displayed on the RF device and they are not allowed to continue the put away. This feature can also be used to ensure that products containing a specified hold category or requiring refrigeration or cage/vault storage are only stored in appropriate locations. To ensure that the attributes used as the criteria for the check are supplied for each bin, the bin options menu is used to establish which fields are required when setting up bin locations for the DC. It is also used to\n28",

The orders associated with that Truck cannot be closed until they are systemically loaded onto the truck.\nOnce orders have been loaded on a carrier trailer and are ready to leave the distribution center, they are dispatched in the WMS system through the shipping pool and ready to be invoiced. Some small shipments are also dispatched in WMS when they are ready to be shipped, but prior to the time when they are loaded on a truck. Only orders in a \"weighed\", or \"pack complete\" status for orders in GWS, and \"Loaded\" in HELIX can be invoiced as these are the appropriate invoice statuses in GWS. GWS and HELIX prevent orders from being dispatched/invoiced in WMS without a carrier tracking number or Pro Number. The BOLs for LTL and FTL shipments are provided to the contracted carrier and the shipments are ready to leave the facility once the carrier signs or stamps the copy which is retained by SCS. LTL and FTL shipments are not dispatched/invoiced in WMS until they have been loaded on the carrier vessel and the carrier has signed a copy of the BOL. Carriers are selected and contracted directly by SCS clients.\nWhen a shipment is dispatched in WMS, a shipping confirmation is sent to the client via an EDI 945 (warehouse shipping advice) message. Shipping supervisors monitor active orders in the WMS shipping pool to confirm that orders which have been physically shipped have been dispatched within the WMS. Based on the client's service level, the order is then invoiced by SCS or sent via EDI to the client for invoicing. When orders cannot be fulfilled due to a lack of inventory, there are three scenarios that could take place depending on the client. The three scenarios are described below.\n. The order is filled with available items and the remaining items are put on backorder. SCS ships available items and backordered items are put on hold. Once SCS has the inventory to fulfill the order, the backordered items are sent to completely fulfill the order.\n. The client does not want SCS to send incomplete orders to its customers; therefore, the order is placed on hold until SCS is able to fulfill the entire order. For these clients, the system is configured not to allow partial shipments.\n. SCS places the order on hold and contacts the client to see how the client would like to proceed with the order.\nPhysical security - distribution centers\nControl objective 7 - physical security - distribution centers\nControls provide reasonable assurance that inventory is secured and protected from unauthorized access and use.\nFacilities are designed based on a number of requirements including efficiency of operation and premises protection. Facilities are protected by systems that include centrally monitored alarm systems, access control systems and fire detection systems. Where appropriate and/or required, these systems have been reviewed with local and/or Federal DEA and state agencies. Physical licenses, where required, are maintained on site at each facility.\nAccess\nEach distribution center is constructed of brick, block, or concrete walls. Distribution Centers have sealed concrete floors and access doors are locked or physically monitored. The roof may only be accessed via internal means and there are no external ladders. The main entry of each facility opens into a controlled foyer. Visitors are required to sign in and out. Visitors must be escorted while in the facility. Employees enter the facility through the same door. No visitor or employee is permitted to enter or exit the facility via a dock or other warehouse door. Access to the building and certain areas is restricted via magnetic key cards or punch code and is limited to active employees.\nThe warehouse is a controlled environment. The warehouse has a number of truck rollup doors, which are kept closed except when loading or unloading a truck. Warehouse pedestrian fire doors are kept locked from the outside and are identified as being alarmed and for emergency use only. Drivers must identify themselves at the drivers' entry. Entry is denied until identification and purpose is determined. Drivers must present photo government ID for inspection at the guard house before entering the yard. Drivers must present photo government ID a second time at the dispatch office before taking possession of a load of entering the warehouse. Drivers are required to remain in the loading area near their vehicles and are escorted if there is a requirement to come into the office.\n35",

        "content": "Returns\nControl objective 4 - returns Controls provide reasonable assurance that returned products are authorized, tracked, and recorded accurately and timely.\nGWS Returns processing\nReturns arriving at the facility are immediately segregated upon receipt and taken to a Returns Cage or designated returns area. Returns will remain in the designated returns area until processed. Returns can generally be classified in one of two categories - 'authorized' or 'unauthorized'. If a return is classified as 'authorized', the return typically would have been authorized by either the client or UPS Customer Service prior to the returned product arriving at the facility, and a Return Goods Authorization (RGA) would have been created in advance by the client or UPS Customer Service which specifies the expected product and quantity that would be received. If a return is classified as 'unauthorized', the return would not have been expected at the facility prior to arrival. When unauthorized returns are received, the level of approval and procedures required to process the unauthorized returns will vary depending on the client instructions. In some instances, client approval is required prior to processing the unauthorized return, and the client will provide an RGA or return number to receive the return against. In other instances, UPS Customer Service will create the RGA to receive the return against. Furthermore, the client may authorize operations personnel to create the RGA on- site and receive the unauthorized return in the system without any additional approvals required. Each client's requirements are outlined in their respective work instructions and appropriate approval as defined by the client is obtained prior to receiving customer returned product into GWS.\nFor most clients, the process for receiving returned products into the warehouse is similar to the normal receiving process with the PO replaced by a Return Goods Authorization (RGA). As with the PO and a receipt, an ASN must be created in GWS prior to receiving the return and in some cases may be created by the client through EDI or a CSR prior to the return being physically received at the DC. In some instances, the RGA is created by the DC associate with prior written e-mail communication from the CSR or the client authorizing the return.\nFor clients who request it, returns are adjusted back into inventory via inventory adjustments rather than through the receiving process. For these returns, the inventory is adjusted into inventory in a Returned Good (RG) or Returned Damaged (RD) hold status, with the Return (RT) number provided by the client included in the note line of the adjustment.\nWhen a return is received at the warehouse for both processes mentioned above, a returns clerk inspects the packing sheet, if available to verify that everything listed on the sheet was received. Once this has been done, the clerk determines whether an RGA already exists in GWS for returns processed through a warehouse receipt. In some cases, the RGA number is listed on the return shipping label and can be utilized in assisting the clerk in determining whether an RGA already exists in GWS. If not, the clerk creates the RGA, listing the products and quantities received. The GWS system does not require a return reason code. For clients who process returns through inventory adjustments, the RT number is either written on the return shipping label or provided by the client to include in the inventory adjustment note line. During both processes, documentation detailing product information is completed. The documentation is dependent on the work instructions for that client. In some cases, a returns form is completed which lists each product received, the quantity and the lot number. However, for other clients, a Returns Put Away Audit sheet is sufficient documentation. The document is signed or initialed by the clerk as evidence of receipt of the return. The returned product information including the part ID, lot number, expiration date, hold category and quantity noted by the initial returns clerk is reviewed and then confirmed by a second independent returns clerk if required by client work instructions or if the return is unauthorized.\nDue to the fact that most returns are for small quantities of product, they are often received and put away manually in WMS to a pre-defined return location for the relevant client. For large returns, pallets may be created to aid in the put away process and RF devices are used to locate product to specific bins using the same procedures as for receipts, as discussed previously. Once the receipt is complete and the product is put away, the ASN is closed and the ASN reconciliation report is printed, reconciled and retained with the return documentation. For clients set-up to receive inbound receipt confirmations via EDI transmissions, an EDI 944 receipt (warehouse stock transfer receipt advice) confirmation message is sent to the client when the ASN is closed.\n30",

Local management has the responsibility of promoting awareness and monitoring compliance. The policies and standards of SCS are communicated and made available to associates through orientation programs and the Intranet.\nUPS's Board of Directors also influences the control environment. The Board of Directors consists of twelve authorized directors who meet quarterly and on an as-needed basis. Management provides a Board presentation during which time the Board challenges management's activities and results as needed. The Board of Directors has also established an Audit Committee to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities related to accounting, reporting and financial practices of the Company.\nThe Audit Committee has the powers, duties and responsibilities delegated to it by the Board of Directors as set forth below:\n\u00b7 Services of Independent Auditors\n1) Have sole authority to appoint and oversee a registered public accounting firm.\n2) Oversee the work performed by the Company's independent auditors.\n12",

A semi-formal review is required at six-month intervals, at a minimum, to provide employees with an understanding of their performance compared to these expectations.\nThe HR department is responsible for the development and dissemination of policies and procedures. HR acts as the arbitrator of disputes regarding these policies. As the employee advocate, the HR department is charged with the protection of the employee.\nSCS has a formal code of ethics that employees are required to acknowledge and live by as a basis of their employment. The company requires the signature of a non-competition agreement by officers, directors and other key employees of the organization.\nHealthcare compliance supervision\nSCS warehouse facilities are licensed by Health Canada in Canada, Farmatec and the Dutch Ministry of Health in the Netherlands, Singapore Health Sciences Authority in Singapore, Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate in Poland, Food and Drug Administration in the Philippines, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization in India, and the DEA, FDA, and appropriate state agencies in the U.S., as applicable. Management members are required to review and comply with all SCS Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Work Instructions and Procedures Manuals that have been established for the healthcare warehouses. Approved procedures are centrally controlled and periodically reviewed to increase the assurance that they reflect current practice. Training programs are also in place. Internal audits of quality systems, including those for controlled substances, are conducted. The procedures that occur during order entry, shipping and/or the inventory process provide additional checks and balances and enable reporting detail for lot tracking, inventory reconciliation and required Health Canada, Dutch Ministry of Health, Singapore HSA, Poland GIF, Philippines FDA, India CDSCO, and U.S. Federal and State Government regulations, where applicable.\nDemonstrates Commitment to Competence\nWhere UPS utilizes outsourced service providers, the Company considers expectations for competence as part of the selection process and monitors compliance through service level agreements and executing Third Party Governance controls to monitor compliance with UPS policies. If issues or performance gaps are identified that relate to competencies of individuals, such issues are evaluated and changes are made to address the competencies of those responsible for providing services to the Company\nRisk assessment, information and communications, and monitoring activities\nSCS uses a risk assessment program to identify and manage risks that could impact the Company's ability to provide contractually agreed upon service offerings. This process requires management to identify significant risks inherent to its services and systems and to identify underlying causes of risks, measure the risk to SCS, establish acceptable risk tolerance levels, and implement measures to monitor and manage these risks. UPS has an Internal Audit department that performs an annual risk assessment for UPS, including SCS. Audits are scheduled and performed based on the results of the risk assessment to increase the assurance that high risk areas are reviewed. The risk assessment process is focused on the facets of SCS' business. The Risk Assessment incorporates interviewing senior management across the organization. The data is input into a model which results in a compliance score and provides information for SCS to channel its audit resources for the upcoming year. The Internal Audit group largely bases its audit schedules and resource allocations on the results of the risk assessment process.\nThere is a UPS Corporate Intranet site that has overall company information including Policies and Procedures. There is a Policies and Procedures committee that is made up of all business units that is responsible for keeping this section up to date. There is a comments section (with a published due date) that allows employees to input suggestions to the policies and procedures. The Global Finance Group, the Internal Audit team and local managers monitor adherence to these procedures.\nLastly, the warehouse metrics that are monitored are posted throughout each warehouse for employees and management to see.

        "content": "Facilities operating hours are determined by the distribution center manager to meet business needs. Personnel are assigned as required. Temporary employees are prescreened and drug tested by the supplying agency.\nSCS management requires that a security and safety audit is performed by a member of management on a regular basis. As such, a member of management performs, among other things, a test of alarm sensors throughout the facility at least once per quarter.\nSome facilities have a controlled substance area that is subject to inspection and approval by the DEA. The DEA vault is a restricted area. Access must be authorized by Operations or QA. Once an employee is authorized, security is responsible for issuing access into the vault. A list of authorized personnel is posted at the cage and vault entrances and is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure accuracy. The cage contains Schedule 3 through Schedule 5 drugs. The vault contains U.S. Schedule 2 drugs. SCS does not distribute Schedule 1 drugs. If the facility contains a DEA vault, it is located within the DEA cage and is protected by heat and motion sensors.\nAfter-hours access is prohibited for staff level employees (supervisors and leads have access). The facilities are protected by an alarm system that is monitored by a central, ULC certified station. Unauthorized access to the protected premises results in an alarm condition in which both the local police and a member of management are notified (police are only notified in response to panic alarms or if the alarm calls are not responded to by call-list personnel). However, after-hours access may be authorized when required for a business purpose. Such access requires pre-notification to security or the alarm company by a designated authority.\nEach facility is protected by a 24-hour burglar/fire alarm system. The systems are designed to detect after hours unauthorized entry as well as daytime violations of restricted areas or use of unauthorized entry/exit devices.\nThe alarm systems are designed to meet the requirements of each individual facility. The systems, at a minimum, include motion detection devices, door contacts, tamper-proof control units and video surveillance equipment. If a controlled substance cage or vault is included, the protection specified is designed to meet requirements of Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 Part 1301 (relating to Physical Security). The systems for the cage and/or vault are redundant and qualify for Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Certified Level AA. UL AA certification provides evidence that certain levels of protection and best practices are being employed and maintained at the facility. Other physical security measures include electronic codes or card access readers at facility entrances.\nA UL-approved central station monitors the protection systems. Protection systems are zoned to allow the central station to identify the point where a breach has occurred. Those facilities with a cage and/or vault have a separate control unit for the controlled substance areas allowing for independent operation and monitoring.\nFire alarm systems are 24-hour detection systems and cannot be turned off. Minimum protection at each facility includes water flow devices, tamper detection, open stem and yoke valve devices and pump monitoring devices. Facilities have warning horns to notify employees of a fire or water leak. Also, each facility is equipped with the required number of fire extinguishers and other emergency equipment. The fire systems are tested at regular intervals as required by local and state ordinance.\nAlarm procedures carried out at each facility include alarm device testing quarterly and management review of open/close reports. The alarm company is supplied with a current emergency call list and there is a rotating pager procedure in place for management notification in case of an emergency. Written procedures require management to respond to each alarm call and to remain on site until the system has been restored and/or the situation is resolved, and the facility is again under protection.\nDuring hours of operation at least one member of the management team must be on site. No employee is allowed to carry personal property into the warehouse and no property may be removed from the warehouse without management permission. Employees are required to enter and exit the warehouse through designated doors and persons or property entering the facility are subject to search. Keys or numerical pass codes are changed when a key, badge or code holder leaves the Company or is transferred.\n36",

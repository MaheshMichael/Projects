MCH sends DHub reference and pricing information and DHub sends MCH derivatives and accounting information. Trades entered into DHub are automatically sent to MCH with calculated cost, proceeds and gain/loss information.\nFutures and options transactions in the scope of this examination include only those transactions processed on DHub. Manual, off-line spreadsheets used to process derivatives are not in the scope of this report.\nRecording of Derivatives\nThe recording of certain over-the-counter derivatives, including swaps, swaptions and contract for differences are recorded and processed using DHub for locations as noted in Section III 6, Operations Overview and Section IV. Clients and their independent auditors should gain an understanding of the processes, controls and related servicing locations applicable to services provided by State Street for OTC derivatives recorded on DHub.\nDHub is used in two models. The trade post model places DHub \"in front\" of MCH. This allows DHub to capture OTC trade activity and utilizes its functionality to calculate the cash flows and accruals on the OTC trades. This information is then used to verify and update downstream applications such as MCH ensuring the accuracy of client information. All other downstream reporting remains the same as it was prior to the use of DHub.\nThe General Ledger (\"G/L\") Post Model utilizes DHub as a sub-ledger to the MCH accounting platform. Position, cash and trade information from DHub and MCH is passed downstream into a data warehouse where client reporting applications can access the data to complete their respective deliverables.\nError-free electronic OTC derivative trades are automatically received in DHub or loaded manually to DHub before release to MCH. DHub queues are monitored throughout the day to verify that transactions pass edit checks and are posting to accounting timely and accurately. Trades with a \"warning\" or \"error\" status are researched and resolved within established deadlines. For funds using DHub G/L Post functionality, the only reflection of swap data on MCH is through the posting of general ledger entries.\nAuthenticated manual transactions received via facsimile are reviewed for completeness and manually input to DHub or MCH. Completeness of transaction receipt is monitored via callbacks, transmission status, confirmation sheets or end-of-day recap reporting with the investment manager or client. Manual transactions are subject to review by a second individual against the original trade directive. DHub or MCH, through automated edit and validation checks, validate trade input for completeness (required data includes fund, broker, trade date, settlement date, price source code, notional amount, interest bought, spread and net). Exception trades are identified and corrected.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 41",

For nonautomated funds (i.e., complex structure, funds priced after the month-end), the reports are manually prepared by the Client Service Operations teams and are forwarded with supporting documentation to a centralized Regulatory Reporting team. Both automated and manual reports are reviewed for accuracy. Any errors identified on the report are corrected on the report, and only the approved final version of the report is transmitted electronically to the regulators within the defined deadlines.\nAustralia APRA Reporting\nNew portfolios or changes to existing portfolios are processed on ESP based on information from the client, applicable updates or new reporting requirements. A review of the set-up or modifications is performed by a Regulatory and Tax Services (\"RTS\") Senior Accountant or above and the review is evidenced on the General Fund Setup and Data Collection checklist. A quarterly reconciliation is performed by RTS personnel between data in ESP to the MCH Trial Balance (composite level) and reviewed by a RTS Senior Accountant or above. The review is evidenced on the respective APRA form checklist. Differences are researched and resolved.\nU.K. Collective Investment Schemes\nAs part of its contractual responsibilities, Global Delivery U.K. is required to identify all unit/share pricing errors in authorized collective schemes that impact the fourth significant figure and report these to the client. Errors identified are logged centrally and are reviewed by Global Delivery U.K. supervisory personnel.\nFinancial Reporting\nThe accounting and custody controls described in other sections of this examination report should be considered by users of this report when analyzing the controls at State Street designed to completely and accurately record and process client financial information. The controls described in this report collectively contribute to the accurate recording of client financial data. As described in other sections of this report, client financial data is processed and recorded in MCH; Financial Reporting uses the client's financial data reflected in the fund's accounting records on MCH and information provided by the client and third parties (that is subject to the controls and procedures at those organizations) to create shareholder reports.\nThe U.S. Proofs and Audit team (a group within Shared Services) prepares and reviews period-end proof packages (MAPS) and/or Ledger to Sub-ledger (\"LSL\"). A manager in the Proofs and Audit team or Client Operations team reviews each completed proof package for accuracy. Any items found in error during review are researched and resolved. The format of the proof package may be modified to suit a particular type of fund or client; management-level personnel approve any modifications to the standard package. The completed period-end proof packages are provided to Financial Reporting. For Australia and in-scope locations in Europe, the preparation and review of MAPS and/or LSL reporting is performed by Financial Reporting, Global Accounting and other related business units (i.e., custody, depositary/trustee, etc.).\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 90",

As a result, State Street has implemented a Third-Party Risk Management (\"TPRM\") program for assessing and managing risks associated with the use of third-party products and services throughout the engagement lifecycle in a manner consistent with compliance and regulatory requirements.\nTPRM is managed within a governance structure that includes oversight from State Street's Board of Directors including the Technology and Operations Risk Committee, the Third Party and Outsourcing Risk Committee, and the three lines of defense as detailed in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Enterprise Risk Management. TPRM begins with an Inherent Risk Questionnaire (\"IRQ\"), which must be completed by the Business Unit Manager engaging the third party. The IRQ measures the level of inherent risk within a State Street function that is looking to leverage the products or services of a third party to support its business activities. Both the inherent risk rating for the product or service as well as the required due diligence to be performed on the proposed third party are driven by the level of inherent risk determined through the IRQ. The due diligence process includes a series of control review programs, which are completed by the third party to provide visibility on the design of the third party's controls prior to contracting. The program has defined an ongoing monitoring program. The level of inherent risk determines the timeframe for re-assessment, including annual review and update of the IRQ, or whenever there are significant changes to the scope of products or services . Scheduled updates to control reviews with the third party occur on a frequency based on the level of inherent risk.\n3. State Street Governance and Structure\nState Street's approach to risk management involves all levels of management, from the Board of Directors and its committees, including the Risk Committee, the Examining and Audit Committee, the Human Resource Committee, and the Technology and Operations Committee, to each business unit and each employee. Responsibility for risk oversight is allocated so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. Risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through a three lines of defense framework.\n1. The First Line of Defense: The business and functional units who perform day-to-day operational and/or support activities that may give rise to risk operate as the First Line of Defense (\"FLOD\"). The FLOD owns the risks associated with their activities and is responsible for establishing effective internal controls to manage such risks to an acceptable level and promoting a strong culture of risk awareness.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION I\n14",

Certain swap contracts are periodically reset (monthly, quarterly) according to the terms of the agreement. Cash is paid to or received from the broker. The cash movement is a net payment representing the change in value of the swap since the last reset. Instructions are received manually or via SWIFT (MT202/210) and processed to MCH via manual trade entry or automatically. Manual income postings and/or interest accrual adjustments are processed in accordance with investment manager/client instruction and are subject to review by a second individual.\nRecording of Institutional Loans - Wall Street Office (\"WSO\")\nLoan Services, a shared services group within Global Delivery, supports the processing and recordkeeping for institutional loan transactions. Loan Services provides accounting and recordkeeping support for institutional loans held across all product structures, including U.S. mutual funds, partnership products, structured products, non-U.S. and institutional funds. The WSO application and MCH are used to perform institutional loan tracking and accounting as well as provide general ledger accounting and reporting. WSO provides multiple-level accrual functionality on individual credits, commitment level accounting and loan valuation functionality via quotes provided by vendors and stores reference information for institutional loans.\nLoan Services receives manual and electronic trade information from clients or investment managers and other loan market information (e.g., agent notices, prices) directly from market participants. Authorized institutional loan trades received from clients or investment managers are recorded in WSO daily and reviewed by Loan Services supervisory personnel. If a trade summary is received from the client or investment manager it is reconciled to trade activity posted to WSO to verify completeness. For loan positions recorded and maintained in MCH, trade activity from WSO is either automatically or manually updated in MCH by Loan Services. The manually input trade activity is reviewed by a second individual for accuracy and completeness of the posting.\nFor loan positions recorded and maintained in MCH, amortization/accretion and unrealized and realized gains/ losses are calculated via core MCH processing, including the respective loan information. For loan positions not recorded on MCH and maintained solely in WSO, interest and fee accruals, amortization/accretion and unrealized and realized gains/losses are automatically calculated in WSO and then automatically recorded in MCH.\nThe Global Loan Processing Team at Syntel in Pune, India manually input bank loan transactions (i.e., borrowings, combined contract, conversion, interest, interim interest, LOC fees, LOC increase/reduction, optional prepayment, PIK (payment in kind), paydown, prime rate change, rate set, rollover, split contracts, spread change) into WSO based on notices received from the agent bank community.

Prior to the posting of a sell within iTELS, various edit and validation checks are performed.\nWash Sales\nFor funds subject to U.S. tax law, wash sale activity is identified and captured on the MCH Wash Sales Review report or the Automated Wash Sales Application reports. Subsequent reversals are identified on the Automated Wash Sales Application reports.\nSecurity Masterfile\nReference Services, a team within Global Delivery, is responsible for maintenance of the central information files that support the custody and accounting applications used globally.

Global Accounting groups can research investment details directly from the masterfile database through input of an asset or relevant market ID number on MCH.\nReference Data\nThe Alveo application provides centralized data management solutions for reference data. There are three parts to the Alveo solution: Acquisition Management (\"AQM\") is an application that acquires vendor data; Alveo is an application that processes and stores the data; and Distribution, Metering and Entitlements (\"DME\") is an application that formats and distributes data to the RSM on the State Street mainframe.\nAQM is used to schedule, retrieve and monitor vendor feeds based on an established schedule and then sends them to Alveo. AQM then monitors the feed processing progress to the basic (raw vendor) level in Alveo. Vendor feeds that do not meet established processing criteria (i.e., are not received at their scheduled time or take longer than the expected processing time) are reported to Reference Services via the AQM Graphical User Interface (\"GUI\") and all activity is captured for reporting. Reference Services personnel will then take appropriate research and remediation actions based on the specific facts and circumstances.

The scope of this report does not include controls performed in Hong Kong. For custody clients, Global One loaned security positions are reconciled to SMAC/GSMAC borrow positions on a daily basis via Duco. Differences are researched and resolved. For non-custody clients Global One loaned security positions are reconciled to the borrower's reported loan positions based on files sent in from the borrowers on a daily basis. Differences are researched and resolved.\nFor U.S. equities, Loanet, Pirum and Equilend automatically compare shares on loan, cash and rates, or a subset thereof, between DML and the borrower's records. Certain exceptions on the report (e.g., marks, money, orphan, quantity and rate) are researched and resolved. For non-U.S. equities, Pirum and Equilend automatically compare shares on loan, cash and rates, or a subset thereof, between DML and the borrower's records. Exceptions identified are researched and resolved in conjunction with daily processes. In the event a counterparty's records are not available on a given business day, Prime Services works with the external vendor and/or counterparty to receive the records and, upon receipt, review the relevant reconciliation and perform timely research and resolution of exceptions identified.\nCollateral Maintenance\nMarket values of borrowed securities are compared to the collateral value for each counterparty account in the aggregate. If the lender or borrower is not adequately collateralized the appropriate steps are taken to receive additional collateral depending on the collateral process that is being utilized. ITP automatically calculates the required counterparty collateral levels based on market and loan values from Global One and required margin levels. Daily feeds from Global Pricing Services automatically update the loaned security prices for market value, or where market practice dictates an internationally recognized pricing source may be used.\nOnline cash transactions are posted to transfer end-of-day balances for daily activity including new borrows, new loans, borrow returns, loan returns and mark-to-market. Prime Services cash totals for all cash transactions are reconciled to depositories and are reconciled to the appropriate group's cash and security collateral accounts. Reconciliations are reviewed for accuracy.\nFinancing Process\nFor borrowers/clients who utilize the self-financing model each day, the market value of the open loans and all new activity is applied to determine the required collateral amount. This amount is reconciled to the value of the financing trades and the collateral amount is adjusted as needed.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 100",

EPW identifies valuation breaks based upon security price tolerance limits that are determined by the client. Edit checks are automatically performed by EPW and positions with rejected prices are identified on the Rejected Pricing Report.

Evidence of this review is documented in the AFW package as the approver must add a comment to move the package to history status in AFW.\nTransaction Processing\nReceipt and Authentication of Transaction Instructions\nState Street business units receive trade instructions via Electronic Trade Delivery (\"ETD\") or manual delivery. State Street's FTTOP Policy requires that an originator's identity and transaction authority be verified upon receipt of trade instructions. Certain transaction delivery methods are considered secure and do not require additional authentication procedures (e.g., SWIFT, Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\") ID and Secure Transport). Procedures employed to authenticate transactions received via facsimile may include testkey, callback or signature verification.\nETD Trades\nElectronic trade files, including manual trade adjustments, trade cancellations and re-bookings and trade related journal entries, either in the pre-defined State Street or Industry Standard for Institutional Trade Communications (\"ISITC\") format, are delivered through SWIFT, DTCC ID or a user's own applications. Batch transmissions in the ISITC format go directly into the State Street mainframe common processing region (\"ETD Common\") (with the exception of ETF funds using ETF Global Platform) and the Fund ID contained in the trade instruction is systematically compared with the fund header record on MCH for authorization. Record counts and trade amounts are checked against batch trailer records for trades received as batch files. This verifies that the batch transmissions are complete and accurate.\nBatch transmissions not received in the proper industry standard format go through a translation prior to being transmitted to ETD Common. The translation process includes batch header and trailer checking which includes total trades, total shares and net amount for completeness and accuracy. When required by clients or if a header or trailer information is not provided, an acknowledgement message is sent to the client detailing the total number of trades processed.\nSWIFT\nETD Common may receive electronic trades via the SWIFT protocol. SWIFT messages are also monitored for completeness and incomplete files are sent to an exception queue for research and resolution. SWIFT transmissions are encrypted and decrypted through the use of the Relationship Management Application (\"RMA\"). RMA set-up requests are processed upon receipt of an authorized RMA set-up request and approval.\nIf the trailer has been truncated, or the number of files in the trailer does not agree to the records sent, an error acknowledgement message is generated and the transmission is pended.

For money market funds maintaining a floating NAV, security valuations are received from EPW. Alerts are automatically generated through eHorizon for each valuation period (i.e., intra-day) and are period specific. A review of the NAV change is performed and differences in account balances exceeding predefined thresholds are investigated and resolved timely and a review of the NAV change is performed by a second individual.\nReporting\nMonthly Reporting\nMonth-end reports such as the fund/trust's trial balance, statement of condition, portfolio appraisal, capital stock activity (mutual funds only), portfolio purchases and sales, gain/loss, income, etc., are generated and reviewed.\nLuxembourg\nState Street Bank Luxembourg S.C.A. (\"SSBL\") uses custody and accounting applications described in this report. Controls in place are designed to determine whether there is adequate segregation of duties between custody functions (maintaining custody of securities; collecting dividend and interest income; receiving notification of corporate actions and recording such corporate actions; and recording and settling securities purchases and sales transactions in the custody application) and portfolio accounting and valuation functions. Key central administration and custody functions are subject to separate preparation and review processes. Custody and accounting records are automatically reconciled with results reported through the appropriate management reports.\nWritten procedures describing operational standards have been established and communicated to SSBL employees. Specific custody and accounting procedures have been drawn up in relation to portfolio valuation, capital stock and trade processing, compliance with investment policy and investment restrictions, NAV accuracy checks and other pertinent topics. Where some central administration functions are delegated to several parties, procedures also define the coordination and overall oversight performed by SSBL.\nSSBL uses a remote-access computing network for the execution of tasks in support of its custody and recordkeeping functions. SSBL has full access to the systems required to support its normal operations and can enter data and retrieve reports on a real-time basis.

Clients are requested to sign a written FTTOP agreement with State Street specifying the type of security procedures to be used for transfers of funds where there is no immediate exchange of value. Cash disbursements are authenticated for appropriate client authorization in accordance with the client's signed FTTOP agreement or alternative security procedures agreed to by the business unit and client. If a client does not agree to accept the standard FTTOP security procedures or declines to sign the agreement, an approved Client or Business Unit Exception may be submitted. Cash disbursements are automatically (via Expense Manager or eCFM functionality) or manually recorded on VMW, MCH (via CCTX functionality), Hogan (via OMP functionality) and IIP directly. Manually input transactions are reviewed to supporting documentation by a second individual for accuracy and timeliness.\nFor funds utilizing Expense Manager, an individual in Global Accounting selects the allocation methodology (e.g., average net assets, straight line, percentage by fund or fixed amount by fund) in Expense Manager based on client instructions. Expense Manager automatically calculates the amount of the vendor invoice to be allocated based on the selected methodology. The invoice is approved within Expense Manager by authorized personnel and Expense Manager posts the payment to MCH and to Hogan. Expense Manager does not release the payment to post to MCH and Hogan until approved.\nFor funds using eCFM, authorized individuals input the payment amount using pre-established templates that identify the payment type, payee and the appropriate accounting treatment based on rules identified in the initial set-up of the template. The payment is approved within eCFM by a second authorized individual and eCFM posts the payment to MCH and Hogan. The posting of the payment is not released to MCH and Hogan until approved.\nThe payment applications/functionality described below (e.g., VMW, MCH, Hogan/OMP and IIP) perform online edit and validation checks to determine whether the payment information is complete.\nVMW\nVariation Margin Wire (\"VMW\") is an interchange application providing Global Delivery personnel the ability to enter, approve and send U.S. dollar payments.

All manual activity in Alveo is subject to a second level of review by Reference Services personnel that approves the record prior to distribution to MCH.\nAQM is also used as a communication platform utilizing systematic messaging to receive individual new security requests from multiple platforms. The details received in the messages are systematically validated and sent to Alveo for new security creation following established rules within the Alveo platform. AQM systematically provides success/response messages back to the requesting application with newly created State Street Asset ID or details of rejection reason. Each security request received in AQM is viewable in the AQM dashboard with current status of the request. The AQM dashboard is monitored by Reference Services personnel for resolution of any requests that do not pass Alveo's systematic validations and require manual resolution to complete the creation of the security record.\nDME distributes the completed records from Alveo to the RSM. If an Alveo record has been marked for review, it will not be distributed until the review is complete and has gone through the approval \"audit\" review described above. DME monitors the successful distribution and processing by RSM and displays processing errors in the DME GUI for research and remediation based on the specific facts and circumstances. Activity performed by Reference Services personnel is captured in an audit view for reporting purposes, reviewed and requires a comment to be input to track resolution.\nSecurity Masterfile Additions and Amendments\nFor security addition and amendment requests not originally sourced from Alveo, Centralized Processing units or Reference Services personnel manually process security and amendment requests. Upon receipt of a request, Reference Services personnel research the security using outside, independent sources. Security details such as CUSIP, rate, maturity date, issuer name, issuer description, issue date, interest payment dates, basis and frequency are reviewed. Independent sources most often used include Intercontinental Exchange (\"ICE\"), SIX Financial Information, Bloomberg, Refinitiv, S&P and Euroclear. If the CUSIP or SEDOL number given is invalid, personnel attempt to research the security by other criteria and/or contact the requestor to receive a valid identifier. After the security is reviewed using outside sources and changes are approved, the data is entered into Alveo. The Quality Control team performs quality review checks for new additions which have an associated market identifier (e.g., CUSIP, ISIN, SEDOL, etc.). Once security data is entered, MCH automatically cross references to review that the security has not previously been set up. If no duplication is identified, the security is automatically added. If the security is already set up, personnel will reject the addition request and inform the requestor. Supervisory personnel regularly monitor unprocessed request queues.\nAdditionally, Alveo receives Bloomberg intraday feeds that are reviewed by Reference Services personnel in order to cleanse and consolidate security reference data into a gold copy. This data is made available for downstream consumption (e.g., MCH's security master file) upon completion of a secondary review.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n45",

Compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation resulting from failure to comply with regulatory obligations.\nState Street has defined two categories of compliance risk: core compliance risk and embedded compliance risk. Corporate Compliance is responsible for overseeing the management of core compliance risk, which are those instances where the primary risk exposure is the failure to comply with regulatory obligations, through the administration of the Core Compliance Oversight Program (\"CCOP\"). Corporate Compliance is also responsible for ensuring policies to address the management of material core compliance risks are developed and communicated, as necessary. Embedded compliance risk, defined as instances where compliance with regulatory obligations is a component of another risk exposure but not the prevailing risk (e.g., credit risk, technology risk), is managed through specialized risk management programs administered by Enterprise Risk Management.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is responsible for overseeing the design, development and implementation of the CCOP globally. The Chief Compliance Officer meets regularly with the Examining & Audit Committee (\"E&A Committee\") to discuss the effectiveness of the CCOP and has the authority to communicate directly with the E&A Committee on any issues relevant to the CCOP. Annually, the Chief Compliance Officer liaises with the Senior Risk Officers responsible for overseeing areas of embedded compliance risk to compile and report an opinion of compliance risk management practices for each area of embedded compliance risk to the E&A Committee.\nState Street has a Standard of Conduct that describes the principles of business conduct expected of all employees of State Street and its subsidiaries globally.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 16",

In addition, ERM is responsible for developing, or ensuring the integrity of, the risk measurement methodologies and tools that are used to monitor the Firm's risk profile relative to its risk appetite. In situations where a material exposure is at risk of breaching the Firm's risk appetite, ERM is charged with taking the actions it deems appropriate to mitigate or reduce the potential impact to the Firm's earnings, capital or reputation.

The following policies are approved by the Core Compliance and Ethics Committee and the Global Financial Crimes Committee: Fraud Risk Management Policy; Global Gifts and Entertainment Policy; Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy; and Global Political Contributions and Activities Policy.\nRisk Assessment\nState Street has established a robust risk assessment process to identify and evaluate the full scale and scope of its exposures, to analyze how its business activities might evolve as economic and market conditions change, and to help ensure that State Street is operating within the risk appetite defined by the Board of Directors. The Material Risk Identification (\"MRI\") Process is one of State Street's primary risk identification programs and utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify State Street's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off- balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational/technology, fiduciary, business, reputational, and regulatory risks. The primary output from the program is a firm-wide Material Risk Inventory, which is a comprehensive list of the risks that could significantly impact State Street, irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. The material risks are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors on an annual basis to ensure that significant changes to State Street's risk profile are captured on a timely basis. In addition, the quarterly MRI updates focus on identifying emerging risks and triggering events that could cause State Street's exposures to materialize. The Material Risk Inventory forms a holistic view of State Street's risk profile and is used as a foundational element in State Street's risk management and capital planning processes. ERM, and State Street's control functions more broadly, are responsible for providing review and challenge during the risk identification process to ensure that they are effectively capturing all key risks to which the business is exposed.\nMonitoring\nState Street management is responsible for continuously monitoring risk exposure across the company and assessing the design and operating effectiveness of its controls. The monitoring process is accomplished through a variety of ongoing activities, including risk monitoring activities performed by the First and Second Lines of Defense (described in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure), operational event reporting, credit exposure reporting, key risk and performance indicator reporting, and consolidated risk reporting to senior management, oversight committees and the Board of Directors. Management also reviews the results of separate evaluations performed by regulators and Corporate Audit and takes appropriate action to remediate any identified issues. State Street's Board of Directors and senior management provide overall oversight and management review of operating performance. State Street employs a three lines of defense model in which risk management is a shared responsibility among all lines of defense. Refer to the description of the three lines of defense in Section III A3 State Street Governance and Structure - Enterprise Risk Management for further details on State Street's approach to risk management and the related responsibilities.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n13",

Accounts that hold non-domestic equities are at risk of arbitrage activity that can undermine the returns to long-term investors when asset prices become stale. Fair Value pricing may be required based on predetermined market triggers/indicators or specific market events as instructed by the clients. The fair value process is executed after the closing price is established but before the fund NAV is calculated.\nUpon receipt of the EPW Fund Add Form, GPS sets the fund up for fair value pricing (e.g., vendor, trigger, exchanges and confidence level/significant measure, as applicable) within EPW after verifying that the set-up is approved by an authorized State Street employee. EPW automates the ability to invoke systematic fair value pricing based on available market triggers such as S&P 500\u00ae, Russell 1000\u00ae and Russell 2000\u00ae or on a daily basis as specified in the EPW Fund Add Form.\nUpon client request or in accordance with the client's standing instruction, State Street utilizes the EPW application and receives fair value factors from third-party vendors, to apply fair value factors to closing prices from the local exchanges.

Additionally, GPS reviews the files to determine whether they are complete.\nEPW\nDuring account set-up, fund groups specify if the default NAV is the Fair Value NAV or the Local NAV.

EPW systematically identifies pricing exceptions (including derivatives security prices). EPW systematically requires all exceptions to be cleared prior to the prices being delivered to the applicable receiving systems. Upon completion of the batch job, updated prices on MCH are available to internal and external users. Once the vendor prices are loaded to the pricing database, they undergo a rigorous screening process by GPS personnel. Daily, the following checks are performed at the file/vendor source level:\nGPS personnel perform a second source verification of equity prices. This verification is performed where there are two prices available from the primary and the secondary vendors. There is a 0% tolerance for this comparison on closed markets and a 1% for intraday snaps. Any exceptions on the closed markets are researched, typically to Bloomberg, and resolved prior to dissemination throughout State Street applications such as MCH and EPW. Intraday reports are reviewed to identify significant issues with the vendor snapped data. In addition to the second source verification of equity prices, GPS also performs a day-over-day tolerance of these prices. Price movements breaking a predetermined threshold, versus a relevant local index, are researched for news and other relevant information to substantiate the price movement. The results of this research are stored centrally on the GPS intranet website for all global business areas to review.\nFixed income security prices undergo a security level price audit. Current day prices are compared to the previous day at a predetermined threshold to identify securities that fall outside the tolerance level. Security prices that do not pass the tolerance checks are returned to the original vendor in the form of a price challenge.\nIn addition to the collection, validation, enrichment and distribution of pricing-related data, GPS also supports the administration functions on the EPW application. GPS personnel set up new funds and process changes (including fair value) to existing funds in EPW upon receipt of the appropriate EPW Fund Add form from authorized personnel. All completed fund set-ups or changes to EPW are reviewed by a second individual in GPS by comparing the information posted to EPW against the EPW Fund Add form.

The individual security positions in a pool are owned by the sub-funds participating in the pool proportionate to their ownership ratios. State Street's pooling platform is fully integrated into the proprietary custody and accounting platform and provides a robust and scalable solution for complex intra- and extra-fund pooling structures. The pooling process is fully controlled through one centralized processing control screen called PLCP, which is the MCH function code assigned to the Pooling Control Cycle/Process.\nAll pooling controls take place within the PLCP functionality which is embedded in core MCH technology. The process is opened when contributions and/or withdrawals are allocated from the pool's participant fund(s) to the pool. Upon creation of contribution/withdrawal records for the current day, Global Accounting personnel run the request to update the ownership ratios. If there have been no transactions for the day, a zero contribution record is posted. The fund group performs a reconciliation to validate the system- generated ownership ratios and differences are researched and resolved. Based on the new ownership ratios, rebalancing activity is automatically generated and posted at the participating funds' level. MCH replicates new pool activity and automatically posts it at the participating funds' level. Trades that have not been released are identified via an electronic trade processing queue and manually released by Global Accounting personnel. Once the pooling cycle has been completed, the participating fund's NAV calculation is completed using State Street's standard systems, controls and procedures.\nSecurity Valuation\nGlobal Pricing Services\nGlobal Pricing Services (\"GPS\") is a team within Securities Valuation Shared Services that is responsible for the collection, validation, enrichment and distribution of pricing-related data for State Street's global client base. GPS supports the pricing needs for clients requiring daily pricing on the EPW application and clients requiring less time-critical, non-daily valuations on MCH.\nPricing-related data is systematically obtained from third-party vendors as the markets close around the globe or at specific intra-day valuation points for European clients. Pricing administration and data center personnel work in tandem to monitor these transmissions for timeliness to ensure files are received and processed in time to meet client deliverables. Once the files are received into State Street, via real-time or batch data feeds, the security price data is automatically populated in the pricing database, NAVigator, where they are available for data content review by GPS personnel.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 78",

Vendor feeds are electronically fed into the Global Corporate Action System (\"GCAS\") which also feeds the Corporate Action Monitoring System (\"CAMS\"). Vendor feeds with missing or conflicting information are researched and resolved by Corporate Actions Operations personnel. Corporate action feeds are monitored for completeness through record counts and data checks. Non-automated source information is input manually to GCAS and reviewed by a second individual, and when possible verified to a second source. Data entered into GCAS is subject to various format, missing field, validation, limit and check digit controls. Non-U.S. corporate actions are identified by the subcustodians (including the self-custody units), market depositories and vendors. Corporate action information and dividends are received from vendors via leased lines or encrypted over the internet. Corporate action information received from subcustodians is received via SWIFT. Where State Street is reflecting a holder of the applicable security on MCH or SMAC/GSMAC, GCAS retrieves entitled share positions for identified corporate actions automatically from SMAC/GSMAC.\nInformation necessary for corporate action notification is input to GCAS, reviewed by a second individual, if applicable, through reference to source documentation and assigned pending status. Full notifications are generated by GCAS prior to ex-date (expiration date) and sent to Centralized Processing units or investment managers via SWIFT or CAPTAIN. Notification delivery is monitored by IT and any non-delivery items are immediately addressed. If the share position (as detailed on SMAC/GSMAC) is modified prior to ex-date/ expiration date, GCAS' share tracking functionality will automatically identify position changes and generate a re-notification to centralized processing units or the investment manager.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION II\n69",

To ensure that all activity has been posted and that the corresponding custody movement took place, a daily reconciliation is performed between MCH and Hogan. Discrepancies, if any, are researched and resolved by AOPM/Limited Partnerships personnel.\nPeriodically (i.e., daily or monthly), the AOPM/Limited Partnerships Team performs a cash adjusted market value (\"CAMV\") calculation within eCFM to systematically mark-to-market the investments in MCH. Using the current General Partner capital balances, eCFM will perform an automated CAMV calculation by adjusting for cash flows that occurred from the last period ending date through the specified ending date. After the calculation is completed and MCH has been updated, LP Services personnel complete an ending CAMV reconciliation to verify that calculated eCFM ending market values agree to the MCH investment holdings. Differences are investigated and resolved. Additionally, an unrealized period-over-period check is performed to verify the change in MCH unrealized balance is attributed to a General Partner cash flow or new statement update. Differences are investigated and resolved.\nSettlement\nU.S. Settlement\nState Street is a direct participant in two major U.S. depositories: The DTCC and the Federal Reserve Book Entry System. With respect to physical securities, State Street uses DTCC and their Custody program in New Jersey (formerly located in New York) as depository for the majority of physical securities. Actual processing of critical settlement and income-related activity is performed in a split operations environment by securities operations units in the U.S., Canada and India.\nDepository Trust and Clearing Corporation\nState Street maintains an electronic interface with DTCC to send and receive current business day data from State Street's custody application (SMAC) to DTCC. The direct link with OMGEO's Trade Suite ID application, a third-party vendor application, enables State Street to receive and transmit trade ID confirm/affirm messages via multiple transmissions throughout the day. Trade instructions for DTCC are updated to SMAC via electronic feeds from accounting platforms or other trade-entry vehicles, although some are manually input directly into SMAC. Trade instructions are subject to SMAC point-to-point authorization controls and other edits, as necessary.\nOn settlement date minus one, a batch file of ID affirmed sells are compared and matched to client pending trade instructions. The matched sell ID affirmations are sent to DTCC via Network Data Mover (\"NDM\"). Non-affirmed client sale instructions are sent to DTCC electronically on settlement date minus one or settlement date (depending on the timing of trade instruction). A position check at the client/CUSIP level is performed on sells prior to release to DTCC. Only sells with sufficient positions are released. Sells with insufficient positions recycle on the SMAC custody platform until sufficient positions are available.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION I\n51",

Acknowledgement messages update SMAC pending trade records to a settled status if certain key data fields match or are within certain thresholds. Sell transactions for which the counterparty does not agree with the terms (e.g., reclaim trades) are either cancelled or returned by the counterparty creating an electronic acknowledgement message that automatically places the sell to a failed status on SMAC. Unmatched acknowledgement messages and returned deliveries are researched by administrators and resolved prior to end-of-day. Upon receipt of instructions, DTCC adjusts via book entry, share balances of State Street's omnibus account.\nEnd-of-day summary and settlement reports generated from DTCC and SMAC are compared and verified. SMAC share and cash settlement totals are reconciled to depository totals. The final DTCC settlement dollar values are totaled for State Street participant accounts. The net State Street cash position is matched to the DTCC position report and the appropriate funds are sent to/from DTCC to satisfy the settlement obligation. A SMAC cash payments file is created to update the individual client accounts on the Hogan (DDA) application, and an end-of-day batch file updates settlement status in MCH.\nFederal Reserve\nState Street interfaces with the Federal Reserve through a real-time link utilizing the Securities Transfer System (\"STS\"). STS is a Tandem nonstop application that provides position control and custody recordkeeping for U.S. Government and Agency securities held in State Street's book entry accounts at the Fed in Boston. It is also a computer-to-computer communications link to the Fed's National Book-Entry System (\"NBES\"), for automated transmission and receipt of security transfer instructions.\nMost trade instructions are updated to STS via electronic feeds from accounting platforms or other trade entry vehicles, although some are manually input directly on STS. Trade instructions are subject to applicable STS edits and controls. Once updated on STS, the trade instructions flow directly and simultaneously to SMAC and NBES (deliveries only). Upon receipt of instructions, the Fed debits or credits State Street's reserve account and adjusts, via book-entry, share balances of State Street's omnibus account. An acknowledgement message is then sent back to State Street through NBES to STS. STS updates and settles the trade on SMAC and the individual client accounts on the Hogan (DDA] application.\nSTS automatically updates returned sale trades from the Fed to a \"failed\" status (returned trades are those for which the participating broker does not have matching instructions and, therefore, the Fed has reversed settlement). When possible, returned sales are communicated to the originating department. Based on the originating department's response, the returned sales are reprocessed on a best-effort basis prior to the Fed's daily close.\nAdministrators identify unmatched wires from STS and work with the appropriate business unit to resolve any exceptions.

By using FpML, organizations can establish a set of detailed business and operational rules to automate the trade notification process and ensure that appropriate data is provided for update to accounting.\nCustody-Only Model\nState Street's Custody-Only model was designed to enable clients to process activity directly and straight through with little manual intervention by State Street. The Custody-Only model is based on State Street's core custody applications (SMAC/GSMAC). Clients of State Street's Custody-Only model go directly to assigned operational points of contact in Transaction Services or the Client Service team to resolve their issues.\nState Street also services custody-only clients using our MCH platform as the front end to our core custody applications. Controls for these clients are similar to our full-service clients and are described throughout this report as part of our core operations.\nFor certain clients of State Street's Custody-Only model, electronic trade files are delivered through SWIFT, a client's own system, or via a web-based application to ETD Common where the same completeness checks as described above are performed.\nState Street's FTTOP requires that an originator's identity and transaction authority be verified upon receipt of trade instructions. The FTTOP procedures applied to Custody-Only model clients are the same as for other State Street clients as described above.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 38",

Pricing parameters (i.e., pricing sources, pricing methods, foreign exchange sources, tolerance levels) use a standard MCH pricing hierarchy unless instructed otherwise by the client. Priced holdings are available to users once the overnight batch job updates have been completed. The overnight batch cycle includes jobs that apply vendor prices to portfolio positions, after which time the prices are swept to downstream applications such as OSA-ASA.\nGPS compiles a list of unpriced securities for MCH Pricing funds daily. GPS generates unpriced security reports from these holdings files periodically throughout the month and performs the necessary research to find alternative pricing sources to be obtained for month-end pricing on MCH. At month-end GPS releases prices from previously identified sources recorded in the unpriced security database and updates these prices to MCH for application to client holdings.\nThe OSA-ASA price tolerance audit performed by the Global Accounting groups identifies prices requiring further review, including manual, out-of-tolerance, new buys and no tolerance securities. Price tolerance reviews are not performed for non-daily priced Fund of Funds on MCH. The Centralized Processing units supervisory personnel review manual source pricing data, price overrides and other price adjustments (including fair value and other prices received directly from the client or authorized third party) to source documentation. Out-of-tolerance prices are challenged, investigated and corrected as necessary. New buy security prices are agreed to the purchase price. Those exceeding certain predetermined thresholds and no tolerance security prices (those securities for which the previous price was zero and are not a new buy) are agreed to a second source, excluding securities dual sourced by GPS. A review of the resolution of rejected or out-of-tolerance prices is performed by a second individual.\nMoney Market\nIn Ireland and the U.S. (for U.S. funds maintaining a stable $1.00 NAV), money market funds are recorded on MCH at amortized cost. Periodically, in accordance with regulatory requirements and client instruction, Global Accounting personnel obtain market prices, where available, or use alternative pricing methods as authorized by the client. The fund's NAV, using the market prices, is calculated using either a database or priced through EPW and calculated using eHorizon functionality and is compared to the NAV at amortized cost or priced through EPW and calculated using eHorizon functionality.

The Client Services or Client Support personnel will complete the internal applicable collateral documents (e.g., Information Needed for Escrow Receipts, Index Option Escrow Deposit/Withdrawal Request form and Collateral Ticket Asset Segregation form, etc.) depending on the nature of the transaction and/or agreements in place with State Street. The Collateral Services team receives the required collateral documents from the investment manager or Global Delivery, Client Services or Client Support personnel for processing.\nAuthorized instructions are received from clients and asset managers via facsimile, SWIFT, Secure Transport or TLS Secure email for which State Street acts as the directed custodian by processing as directed through the authorized instructions. The Collateral Services team processes these instructions to State Street's custody applications (SMAC/GSMAC) for the global client base.\nUpon receipt, the Collateral Services team will review documentation for completeness and proper authorization.

The Collateral Services team does not alter the instructions in any way. Incomplete instructions are rejected. Collateral Services team personnel process complete and accurate instructions for securities as collateral to the respective category on SMAC/GSMAC and cash as collateral on Hogan/IBS depending on the nature of the request. The Collateral Services team reviews all processing of securities on SMAC/GSMAC and cash on Hogan/IBS for completeness and accuracy to the corresponding instructions. Once review is complete, the collateral is authorized to be released within SMAC/GSMAC and Hogan.\nClient Services or Client Support personnel monitor segregated securities for possible redemptions, maturities and expiration. To release a security for a closed/expired option contract, Client Services or Client Support personnel must obtain approval from the client and/or broker and complete the applicable form requesting release of the collateral. The form is signed by an authorized individual and forwarded to the Collateral Services team for processing on SMAC/GSMAC.\nFor cash escrow receipts issued at the OCC, in the event of a fund liquidating its option position before exercise date, collateral is not released until the broker approves the early withdrawal posted at the OCC. The OCC has updated their process so that security collateral used for escrow receipts is directly released by the broker at DTC.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 47",

Prior to offering subcustody arrangements in a new market, State Street carries out a market risk evaluation, a subcustody Request for Proposal (\"RFP\") process, a subcustodian financial review, an on-site due diligence visit and a legal review. The Deal Team is also involved in recommending subcustodian selection in connection with review of existing markets. Legal and Network Management personnel work jointly to negotiate and execute the subcustody contract which includes defined service levels.\nOnce subcustody services are established, State Street continues to monitor subcustody providers for compliance with service-level agreements. These standards enable client assets to be custodied in an environment where risks have been mitigated to the extent possible.\nNetwork Management personnel, located in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., manage relationships with State Street's worldwide network of agent banks and review their performance on an ongoing basis. Network Management, with support from operational units, monitors each subcustodian's ability to manage large trade volumes; its ability to correctly handle complex transactions; the quality of reporting; the subcustodian's progress in the use of technology and telecommunications systems; steps taken to mitigate risk on behalf of foreign investors; and accuracy and timeliness in communicating market events. Network Management conducts formalized due diligence reviews with each subcustodian relationship on an annual basis. These reviews are facilitated through on-site visits by State Street to a subcustodian, scheduled visits by a subcustodian to State Street or arranged conference calls between State Street and a subcustodian.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 61",

Daily variation margins are payments made in cash on behalf of State Street Bank International GmbH's clients and their counterparties. Cash is transferred to clearing banks.\nInitial margin requirements are reviewed by State Street Bank International GmbH daily. If the value of pledged securities falls below initial margin requirements, the clearing bank informs State Street Bank International GmbH and the client who is obligated to identify additional securities to be segregated in order to satisfy the requirements of the stock exchange.\nCollateral Held Externally\nFor certain portfolios, collateral for derivative transactions is delivered to and held by the broker or other authorized third parties. The Collateral Services team or Global Delivery personnel record the collateral activity (delivery and returns) at the time of the delivery/return. In addition, Global Delivery personnel may deliver collateral to external brokers or banks for other instruments and/or transactions requiring hard segregated collateral.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n48",

The reconciliation is performed by Global Accounting personnel and reviewed by supervisory personnel.\nDriverless NAV (\"DNAV\")\nDNAV is a service which moves NAV processing from deadline-based to event-based operations. The system \"drives\" itself with minimal human intervention. Tasks and workflows within DNAV are conducted through straight-through processing with users' time being used to analyze data and validate exceptions through automated alerts.\nDNAV Onboarding\nPrior to going \"live\" on DNAV, a fund must meet certain data eligibility requirements which includes being set up on certain related services/tools (e.g., Expense Manager, Income Change, GL Alerts, etc.). Given the eligibility requirements, not all funds are currently using the DNAV service.\nUpon meeting the DNAV requirements, authorized personnel instruct the BOAT or the eHorizon Deployment Team (as applicable) to set up the fund on DNAV and EDW by either providing a fund number to \"clone\" or by submitting an eHorizon Fund Level Service Setup Request Form (which includes workflow specific to the fund, live date, fund type, etc.). Fund Accounting personnel perform a weekly review of funds set up on DNAV and communicate approval or submit required changes to the Global Delivery Simplification Team.\nCritical Alerts\nCertain alerts generated through DNAV tools are classified as \"critical alerts.\" Critical alerts are automatically generated when transaction-related tolerances are exceeded/breached. Critical alerts require the initial reviewer to investigate, research and resolve alerts by posting a response. A second individual must review the response and either approve or reject the response for further investigation. An approval is required before the alert is \"cleared.\"\nEvent Driven Workflow (\"EDW\")\nUpon completion of the set-up on DNAV, funds are able to leverage EDW functionality. EDW is a service which uses event-based operations to automate the processing of the NAV and reduce manual intervention. EDW leverages MyView/Process Monitor to link events (called \"Milestones\") together to trigger subsequent processing. Events that do not complete automatically appear in a critical status in MyView/Process Monitor to be actioned before processing can continue. Reversal and reprocessing logic is built in to ensure accurate deliverables. Critical alerts are generated throughout the processing of each of the EDW milestones described below.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 85",

Core operating teams reside in Canada, India, the U.K. and the U.S. International income processing is based on market type (\"on\" or \"off\" book). Income is advanced to the client on payable date for select markets in accordance with State Street's Contractual Income policy. Income from markets not included in the Contractual Income policy, income is processed on an actual receipt basis.\nOn-Book Income Processing\nOn-book international income receivables are created and maintained on the Global Income Control application (\"GIC\") based on information provided from the Security Masterfile, the Global Tax Table and the Global Dividend database. Entitlements are established based on GSMAC security positions.\nCash payment information is received from GIC via SWIFT MT564/MT566 messages from the subcustodian depository. Cash is systematically posted to client accounts via IBS. Cash receipts are then matched to MCH receivable records. Exceptions are researched by Global Income Services. Receivables may be created or adjusted, as appropriate, to allow the income payment to be systematically posted to MCH.\nOff-Book Income Processing\nFor off-book markets, whereby the subcustodian maintains the transaction records for individual cash accounts, income receivables are created and maintained on GIC based on information provided from the Security masterfile, Global Tax Tables and the Global dividend database.

Receivables may be created or adjusted, as appropriate, to allow the income payment to be systematically posted to MCH.\nCollection of Past-Due Income\nFor on-book markets, GIC identifies the anticipated sources of income payments (i.e., due from the subcustodian, a Securities Finance broker and/or a counterparty in the market). This information facilitates the collection of income from counterparties and is also used to identify which portions of income are eligible for payment under the Contractual Income policy. Monitoring of past-due income occurs through the use of the Income Tracking System for each market, regardless of whether the income is paid on a contractual or actual receipt basis. Income receivables are identified through review of the Income Tracking System or custody records. Income Services determines if the receivable is valid and assigns a status code to the Income Tracking Record. A claim for past-due income is sent to the appropriate broker and follow-up continues until receipt. Updates are recorded on the Income Tracking System. Past-due income status reports, which includes an aging analysis, are produced and regularly reviewed by Income Services.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III 64",

DML automatically determines the borrower's credit limit, availability of free securities, opening and daily margin requirements and loan concentration based on lender restrictions. DML automatically notifies the settlement area of the loan.\nDML automatically allocates the loaning of securities based upon an established portfolio queue. This allows for a fair and weighted allocation of loans based on the amount of securities the portfolios have available to lend. Operations and trading personnel have the ability to override the automated queuing process under prescribed circumstances. User access to process override transactions is limited to specific personnel and access is controlled by the respective employee's manager. Overrides are processed to assist in loan processing in certain circumstances, including but not limited to, corporate actions and market restrictions. Users that have access to process overrides are reviewed annually for appropriateness based on job responsibility. Users are required to enter a mandatory reason code in DML when processing override transactions. Mandatory reason codes are established and approved by the Securities Finance compliance department. Once a loan has been entered into DML, the loaned security is delivered to the borrower through the various clearing organizations. Failing loans are monitored, researched and resolved by the appropriate settlement desk.\nFor borrower requests received electronically, DML automatically matches loan requests to portfolios by CUSIP and description, and loans on securities are allocated and granted. Any loans granted are executed based on predetermined rebate rules and dependent upon lender and borrower criteria.\nLoan Maintenance and Borrower Agreement Monitoring\nGlobal Income Services is responsible for tracking income receivables on loaned securities. Daily, Global Income Services generates claim sheets for income receivables identified on loaned securities. After claim sheets are distributed, the income receivables are reviewed with the borrower by Global Income Services. The borrower remits payment to Global Income Services directly. The details of these conversations may be documented in the SLCP tracking tool (\"SLCP\").\nGlobal Delivery Corporate Actions is responsible for the processing of corporate actions. Corporate action announcements are received from Corporate Actions Processing via a feed into SLE. Corporate action notifications are compared to lending activity. Securities that are affected by corporate actions are subject to lending activity restrictions. Required modifications are processed to the on-loan positions in DML, or the securities are called back from the borrower. Lender entitlements are collected from the borrowers and distributed to client accounts.\nDaily, as part of a multi-step reconciliation process, Securities Finance personnel reconcile several processes which include a reconciliation of daily transactions (loans, loan terminations and mark-to-markets) with each borrower, a reconciliation of daily collateral transactions with each borrower (cash and non-cash collateral) and a final collateral reconciliation to DML.

Global Delivery personnel provide pertinent security information. Reference Services personnel monitor the intranet application for requests. Requests are processed in a timely manner. New requests are assigned a request ID for tracking purposes. Alveo sourced securities are created with Bloomberg as primary vendor source and matched to a Refinitiv record for linking of the Refinitiv Identification Code to the Bloomberg data. For non-Alveo requests processed in MCH, Reference Services personnel use Reuters to independently review the accuracy of the information detailed on the addition request. If Reuters does not identify a derivative, Bloomberg is used as a secondary source. If Reuters confirms the security data, an asset identifier is assigned and MCH automatically cross references to review that the security has not already been set up using key data fields. An addition can only be added to MCH without a vendor identifier as OTC (over the counter). Once the cross reference is complete, the derivative is added to MCH. If there are significant discrepancies between the request and Reuters, the request is rejected back to the requestor for additional information.\nSecurity Factors and Rate Resets\nGovernment Paydown Factors\nState Street receives monthly data transmissions from SIAC for GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC pooled assets and daily transmissions from ICE for CMOs, IOs and other asset-backed securities. These data transmissions are received into the reference database from outside vendors and are automatically updated to MCH. File transmission is monitored for completeness through record counts. MCH performs automatic tolerance checks prior to the data upload to the Government Factor Database. To review the accuracy of the daily data transmissions received from ICE, items that change greater than the predetermined tolerance level in MCH will be printed on an exception report. Reference Services personnel agree these factors to an outside source (e.g., Bloomberg) and manually update MCH as appropriate. Discrepancies are resolved through discussions with ICE and Bloomberg personnel.\nRate Resets for Variable Rate Demand Notes\nMunicipal Market Data (\"MMD\") updates rate resets for VRDNs twice a day by transmitting Variable Rate Feeds to State Street. Variable Rate Feeds are monitored for completeness and accuracy through record counts and date checks. After the transmission has been received and checked for completeness, a Reference Services administrator reviews the reports online to identify errors and views a summary of total rate changes for tolerance checks. The review on these reports is to gauge the accuracy of the transmission and to monitor the percentage of total rates loaded and updated. The fund groups are then informed of the availability of the rates via a daily notification accessed through MCH. Rate resets and factors are automatically applied to client holdings.\nSOC 1\u00ae - SOC for SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: ICFR\nSECTION III\n46",

MCH automatically calculates withholding taxes timely and establishes accruals for income and tax reclaim receivables.\nThe tax reclaim coordinator monitors accrued tax receivables and prepares and files required documentation with the subcustodian or the country's tax authority. Market practice and, in some cases, residency dictate filing frequency and follow-up confirmation steps. Reclaims are monitored by Custody Tax Services via a weekly status summary report. Follow-up steps are taken as needed to confirm filing status prior to the expiration of the statute and limitations and again to ensure timely payment receipt. Payment information is processed automatically or manually by the Custody Tax Services Payment Team, which updates TRS and the receivable on MCH to a PAID status.\nReduction at Source and Exemptions\nReduction at source or up-front filing refers to those circumstances whereby clients may be paid income net of tax withholding and reclaim amounts. Depending on the market, documentation may need to be filed annually or based on each income event in order to effect these opportunities. Exemptions generally allow an eligible investor to receive income gross. Subcustodian account openings are monitored for applicable markets to request documentation from business areas for execution and proper filing.\nTax Reclaims\nTax reclaim receivables are generated on TRS and MCH at the time of the income event based on rates contained within the GTT.

The TRS platform integrates client and market information with custody data to create and track receivables. TRS tracks receivables through their entire life span from creation to payment using descriptive status codes. Documentation requirements are tracked by TRS and reclaim forms are generated by the application on behalf of the individual beneficiary for each reclaim market. The forms are forwarded to the appropriate party for signature and certification nor signed under an applicable Power of Attorney (\"POA\"). Tax reclaims are filed on an ongoing basis or batched according to market practice and filed with the subcustodians or directly with the tax authority.
